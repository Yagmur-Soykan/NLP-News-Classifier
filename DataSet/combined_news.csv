Technical,"Elon Muskmay have stepped awayfrom his duties as the lead of theDepartment of Government Efficiencyand adviser to President Trump, but he’s still active in D.C. circles. This time, he’s on the other side, lobbying lawmakers on legislation related to autonomous vehicles, according to areport by Bloombergthat cited unnamed sources.

Musk and others in his orbit have been calling members of Congress directly, according to Bloomberg. His efforts appear to be directed at a bill introduced May 15 called theAutonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act.

Musk has bet much of Tesla’s future on AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. He has frequently tied the company’s value to its investment and eventual commercialization of autonomous vehicles. And next month, Tesla is expected to launch a small andgeofenced robotaxi servicein Austin, Texas. Tesla also wants to eventually roll out autonomous vehicles — branded Cybercabs — that don’t have a steering wheel or pedals. But today there are not clear federal rules or standards to allow such a vehicle to operate at scale."
Technical,"Elon Musk’s X experienced an outage on Friday, according to user reports and crowdsourced data from sites likeDowndetector. From what TechCrunch staff has witnessed firsthand, the X website and app still loaded, but various features were not functioning properly, and entire feeds — like X’s algorithmic For You feed — didn’t load any content.

Others reported thatphotos weren’t loading,X’sbanking service XMoneywasn’t working, the timeline was bare, posts weren’t publishing, and search wasn’t returning results, among other things.

Based on the timing of the user reports, the outage and errors seem to have begun just before 4 p.m. ET on Friday and seem to be resolving as of the time of writing.

During the outage,thousands of users submitted reports to Downdetector,and others more directly complained in X posts and on other social networks, like Bluesky and Threads.

This was the second outage for X in just over a week, as the service also failedon May 22,when X experienced a number of issues over a 24-hour period. During that time, messages wouldn’t load, timelines wouldn’t update, and some posts couldn’t be seen without refreshing the webpage.

The current outage may be short-lived. We noticed that some features seemed to either be intermittently working, or worked on X’s mobile app but not on the desktop, for instance. Then, people began reporting that the service seemed to have come back up.

The X Developer API v2 is stillshowingdegraded status, however.

Just ahead of the outage, X beganrolling out its new DM feature, XChat, into beta afterpausing encrypted DMsas it worked to make improvements. It’s not clear if any of these changes impacted X’s stability, and the company no longer responds to press inquiries since Musk took ownership."

It might have been a short week, but there was still plenty of news, including anotherZooxrecall, an update on theStellantis-Amazonpartnership, and a few startup-funding deals.

One item of note: This week, I wrote aboutCarma Technologyand itspatent infringement lawsuitagainstUber. This isn’t a patent troll situation, and the IP attorneys I have spoken with say it will be a challenging case for Uber.

The gist? Carma, which was formed in 2007 by serial entrepreneur and SOSV Ventures founder Sean O’Sullivan, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against Uber, alleging the company infringed on five of its patents that are related to the system of matching riders (or packages) with capacity in vehicles. In other words, ride-sharing.

IP attorney Larry Ashery provided the money quote that explains why this is such a complicated and challenging case.

“What’s important to understand here is, Carma isn’t just asserting five patents. They have had a very sophisticated strategy of patent procurement that they’ve been working on for the past 18 years.”Carma’s five patents are part of a 30-patent family that are all related and connected to the original filing date. That matters because each of the five asserted patents contains multiple patent claims, which define the legal boundaries of the invention. These individual claims — not just the patents as a whole — are what Carma is asserting against Uber.

That means Uber will have to address and defend against each asserted claim, making the litigation more complex and difficult to defeat, Ashery noted.

Let’s get into the rest of the news.

A few little birds have been chirping at us for months now about a new autonomous vehicle technology startup that has been quietly plugging along for a year. The interesting nugget about this startup — which is calledBedrock Robotics— is who is behind it:Boris Sofman, who ledWaymo’s self-driving trucks program and previously co-founded and led the popular consumer robotics companyAnki.

The San Francisco-based startup is still in stealth, but my sources tell me it has raised considerable venture funds. Bedrock Robotics is working on a self-driving kit that retrofits onto construction equipment and other heavy machinery,according to a filingwith the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Zooxissued itssecond voluntary softwarerecall in a month, following a collision between one of its robotaxis and an e-scooter rider in San Francisco on May 8. The incident is notable, largely for what happened after the unoccupied Zoox vehicle operating at low speed was struck by the e-scooter after braking to yield at an intersection.

According to Zoox, the e-scooterist fell to the ground directly next to the vehicle and the “robotaxi began to move and stopped after completing the turn, but did not make further contact with the e-scooterist.”

In other Zoox news, the company announced it was the “official robotaxi partner of Resorts World Las Vegas.” As part of the deal, there will be a dedicated and Zoox-branded robotaxi pickup and drop-off location at Resorts World Las Vegas.

Technical,"The chief executive of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) says Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency left the nonprofit’s Washington, D.C., headquarters in disarray, full of water damage, rats, and roaches, according toa new sworn statementfirst reported byCourt Watch.

The statement from the executive, George Moose, comes just a few days after a federal judgeruledthat DOGE’s takeover of the nonprofit was illegal. And this week, Musk has claimed he is stepping away from DOGE, although he and President Trump have said he will continue to advise the administration.

DOGEstarted its takeoverof USIP in mid-March after a standoff that saw the nonprofit call the police on Musk’s government workers. Moose said at the time that DOGE staff had “broken into” the USIP headquarters in Washington, despite the fact that the nonprofit is not part of the executive branch and isn’t subject to the White House’s whims.

“It was very clear that there was a desire on the part of the administration to dismantle a lot of what we call foreign assistance, and we are part of that family,” Moose said at the time, referencing the Trump administration’s and DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development.

Moose initiallysaidthe nonprofit’s headquarters appeared to be in decent shape at a press conference on May 21, where he discussed the judge’s ruling. But one day later, according to the statement, members of Moose’s staff spent a day surveying the building and documenting the problems they found.

Moose wrote in his statement that, ahead of the judge’s ruling, the headquarters had been “essentially abandoned for many weeks” before USIP regained control. He said that DOGE had failed to “maintain and secure the building,” including “evidence of rats and roaches.”

“Vermin were not a problem prior to March 17, 2025, when USIP was actively using and maintaining the building,” Moose wrote.

Staff also reported to Moose that the building’s vehicle barriers were poorly maintained and that they spotted water leaks and “missing ceiling tiles in multiple places in the building (which I have been told suggest likely water damage).”

Now Moose said USIP has “engaged a private security firm to guard the building and premises” and “taken over responsibility for the building’s maintenance.”"
Technical,"If the adoption of AI feels different from any tech revolution you may have experienced before — mobile, social, cloud computing — it actually is.

Venture capitalist Mary Meeker just droppeda 340-page slideshow report— which used the word “unprecedented” on 51 of those pages — to describe the speed at which AI is being developed, adopted, spent on, and used, backed up with chart after chart.

“The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data,” she writes in the report, called “Trends — Artificial Intelligence.”

There’s a certain poetic history to this person writing this kind of report. Meeker is the founder and general partner at VC firm Bond and was onceknown as Queen of the Internetfor her previous annual Internet Trends reports. Before founding Bond, she ran Kleiner Perkins’ growth practice, from 2010-2019, where she backed companies like Facebook, Spotify, Ring, and Block (then Square).

She hasn’t released a trends report since 2019. But she dusted off her skills to document, in laser detail, how AI adoption has outpaced any other tech in human history.

ChatGPTreaching800 million users in 17 months: unprecedented. The number of companies andthe rate at which so many othersare hitting high annual recurring revenue rates: also unprecedented.

The speed at which costs of usage are dropping: unprecedented. While the costs of training a model (also unprecedented) is up to $1 billion, inference costs — for example, those paying to use the tech — has already dropped 99% over two years, when calculating cost per 1 million tokens, she writes, citing researchfrom Stanford.

The pace at whichcompetitors are matching each other’s features, at a fraction of the cost, including open source options, particularly Chinese models: unprecedented. For example, she points out that Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell GPU uses 105,000x less energy per token than the company’s 2014 Kepler GPU predecessor.

Meanwhile, chips from Google, like its TPU (tensor processing unit), andAmazon’s Trainium, are being developed at scale for their clouds — that’s moving quickly, too. “These aren’t side projects — they’re foundational bets,” she writes.

The one area where AI hasn’t outpaced every other tech revolution is in financial returns. WhileVCs are pouring moneyon the AI fire as fast as they can, AI companies and cloud service providers are also burning through cash. AI requires massive investments in infrastructure.

That’s good for consumers and enterprises, the beneficiaries of fast improvements, while competition lowers costs, Meeker points out. But the jury is still out over which of the current crop of companies will become long-term, profitable, next-generation tech giants. “Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land,” she writes.

As for the rest of us: Just hold on to your hats."
Technical,"The Department of Energy announced today that it would be clawing back $3.7 billion worth of awards made under the Biden administration for clean energy and manufacturing. Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.

Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to amemorandumhe issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards.

In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy:

Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations.

Brimstone is hopeful that things can be resolved with the DOE.

“Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding. Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin told TechCrunch via email.

“As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make portland cement — would clear a ‘mine-to-metal’ path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs,” she added."
Technical,"WordPress.com parent company Automattic is changing direction… again.

Ina blog posttitled “Returning to Core” published Thursday evening, Automattic announced it will unpause its contributions to the WordPress project. This is despite having said only last monththat the 6.8 WordPress releasewould be the final major release for all of 2025.

“After pausing our contributions to regroup, rethink, and plan strategically, we’re ready to press play again and return fully to the WordPress project,” the new blog post states. “Expect to find our contributions across all of the greatest hits — WordPress Core, Gutenberg, Playground, Openverse, and WordPress.org. This return is a moment of excitement for us as it’s about continuing the mission we’ve always believed in: democratizing publishing for everyone, everywhere,” it reads.

Automattic says it’s learned a lot from the pause in terms of the many ways WordPress is used, and that it’s now committed to helping it “grow and thrive.”

The post also notes that WordPress today powers 43% of the web.

It’s unclear what has changed.

However, according to sources who spoke to TechCrunch, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg explained in an internal post published last night that he wants to get a 6.9 release out this year with an admin refresh and something from the “new AI team.” (The latter references this week’s announcement thatWordPress formed a new team to steward the development of AI projects.)

“I don’t think that will happen without our contributions,” the post stated, according to a source familiar with the internal discussions.

Insiders are speculating there’s more to it than that, and various theories are being floated. Some wonder if Mullenweg was pressured into this move or if he realized that pulling back wasn’t good for his business or its reputation? Others are debating if this change of heart has to do with Automattic’s ongoing litigation with WordPress’ hosting company, WP Engine, which Automattic has called a “threat” to the WordPress communityand a “cancer to WordPress.”

No one knows what to believe, and none of these backchannel theories line up with the officially stated reason.

Automattic was asked for additional comment.

Since 2024, Automattic has been engaged in a legal dispute that has to do with how little, in Mullenweg’s opinion, WP Engine contributes to the WordPress project, despite its size and revenue.

He sees the hosting company as profiting off the open source work WordPress is doing without giving back. Mullenweg also alleges that WP Engine benefits from the confusion between WordPress and commercial services like WP Engine. This led him to ban the company from accessing WordPress.org and sue in court forunauthorized trademark usage.

Simply put, Mullenweg thinks WP Engineshould either paya direct licensing fee or up its contributions to the open source WordPress project, or shouldn’t be allowed to use its trademark.

WP Enginerespondedthat it doesn’t think it needs a license and that Automattic misunderstands trademark law,suing Automattic in return.

Last month,Automattic laid off 16% of staff,saying the restructuring was necessary to be more agile and improve its productivity and profitability.

Technical,"A little-known patent infringement lawsuit could have big implications for Uber — and potentially dozens of other companies.

Carma Technology, a company formed in 2007 by serial entrepreneur andSOSVfounder Sean O’Sullivan, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against Uber alleging the company infringed on five of its patents that are related to the system of matching riders (or packages) with capacity in vehicles. In other words, ridesharing — a business Carma operated in some form for a decade until it changed its business model and applied its tech to road-pricing services like GPS tolling and HOV verification.

Carma has requested a jury trial and is seeking a permanent injunction against the company, mandatory future royalties on any Uber products that infringe on those patents as well as damages, and other costs related to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit, which has been quietly winding its way through the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, is relatively new. The allegations have been swirling for nearly a decade.

Carma lawyers first contacted Uber about its ridesharing and ground transportation patents in 2016, according to the complaint. That was an auspicious time for Uber. The startup, which was founded just seven years before, had shot into the stratosphere — in terms of valuation, growth, and gravitas.

Uber wasvalued at $66 billionat the time, and had a reputation for takingbig, legally sticky swingsinto new markets that helped it grow to hundreds of cities in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and the Middle East. It had raised more than $12.5 billion in venture capital, and was using it to launch new products and evenpush into autonomous vehicles.

Uber might have had the business model and the market share, but it didn’t have the specific ridesharing patents, O’Sullivan told TechCrunch in a recent interview. Carma does — plus acouple dozen others. Uber was allegedly aware of that fact as early as 2015 when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected one of its applications because it ran up against existing patents held by O’Sullivan and Carma, according to the lawsuit.

At least four of Uber’s patent applications — and in some cases numerous revisions to those patents — were rejected between 2016 and 2019 for the same reason. The rideshare giant would eventually abandon some of those applications.

Uber still holds hundreds of other patents covering a broad swath of technology and ideas that have been applied to its business.

O’Sullivan argues the core service of what Carma’s patents describe is exactly how the modern day ridesharing experience operates. And he contends that Uber is infringing on those patents even if the company’s business model operates more like a taxi business.

The case is a complicated one, intellectual property attorney Larry Ashery told TechCrunch. (Ashery is not involved in the case.)“What’s important to understand here is Carma isn’t just asserting five patents,” said Ashery, whose practice is based in the Greater Philadelphia area. “They have had a very sophisticated strategy of patent procurement that they’ve been working on for the past 18 years.”

He noted the five patents are part of a 30-patent family that are all related and connected to the original filing date. That matters because each of the five asserted patents contains multiple patent claims, which define the legal boundaries of the invention. These individual claims — not just the patents as a whole — are what Carma is asserting against Uber.

That means Uber will have to address and defend against each asserted claim, making the litigation more complex and difficult to defeat, he noted. Ashery said Uber’s strategy will likely be to try to invalidate these patents, which will be a challenge.

While Carma might have been armed with these specific patents, it took nine years for the company to actually sue Uber. Bunsow De Mory, a Redwood City-based law firm, is representing Carma in the case.

“When any business starts, it’s all about just actually capturing the market and winning in the marketplace,” O’Sullivan said. “Patents are meant to protect against aggressors from stealing the idea, but it’s not the main focus of your business to get patent revenue. It’s more as a protective mechanism.”

Carma, he said, has been “very busy building a multimillion-dollar business and getting to profitability.” But there are other reasons for that nine-year time gap, O’Sullivan explained. For one, the cost.

“It’s incredibly expensive to sue a large company over IP and Carma is a relatively small organization,” he said in a recent interview. “To come up with the $10 million-plus to take on a big patent suit, which is what it takes these days, is not a small task.”

O’Sullivan said the company did reach out to Uber as far back as 2016 “in the hopes that they would do the right thing and license our patents.”

“It really took us a while to come to terms with the idea that we actually had to sue Uber in order for them to respond,” he added.

Uber declined to comment on the lawsuit. Uber’s attorneys did make two procedural motions this week, including a sealed motion to dismiss for improper venue or alternatively to transfer venue for convenience. This procedural motion signals Uber’s desire for the case to be litigated in the Northern District of California, where it is based, rather than in Texas.

Notably, the lawsuit is aimed at Uber, not Lyft or other companies using ridesharing. O’Sullivan explained Carma is “going after the biggest player first” and noted that about 60 other companies are likely infringing on its patents.

The primary argument in the lawsuit ties back to five patents that have been granted to O’Sullivan and Carma, which was originally named Avego.

It all started with O’Sullivan’s frustration with traffic congestion, which ultimately led to thoughts about carpooling and how an automated system using smartphones could help people coordinate rides. That idea would turn into the startup Avego and become the basis of the first patent —No. 7,840,427.

The first patent, which O’Sullivan applied for in 2007 and was granted in 2010, created a shared transport system that matches empty space in a vehicle with riders or goods. The system established a set of pick-up and drop-off points and then matched users and drivers traveling along a similar route.

Before the patent was granted Avego’s ridesharing app debuted on Apple’s App Store in 2008, the same year the iPhone launched. Avego showed off its so-calledShared Transport appat the DEMO conference in 2008, which showed how a driver with an iPhone 3G could use the app to accept or reject a ride request. Once accepted, the rider was notified as the driver approached and then was prompted to enter a pin code to prove their identity and authorize an electronic payment.

Avego, which would later change its name to Carma, was focused on the promotion of ridesharing (as in carpooling) and not taxis, according to O’Sullivan. The company operated the carpooling business until October 2016, when the app was withdrawn from the App store. However, it still had other forms of ridesharing, like its partnership with Toyota, until phasing it out altogether in April 2018.

“If you look at the definition of ridesharing in federal legislation, it is carpooling,” O’Sullivan said, noting that Carma built up a multimillion-dollar ridesharing business in its early days.

When Uber and Lyft came in and tried to co-opt the term ridesharing to mean taxi-hailing it caused confusion in the market, prompting Carma to change its business model and apply its tech in new ways. “Uber and Lyft really took ridesharing in the direction of taxi services, but our company Carma didn’t want to,” O’Sullivan said.

Carma is still focused on reducing traffic congestion, but its tech is applied to a different business model.

Today, Carma uses its app to help transit authorities manage tolls and express lanes — a product line the company first rolled out in 2013. For instance, the app can be used by a driver on a toll road or even track vehicle occupancy for HOV lanes. The app is designed to get more riders into cars and reward those people by reducing tolls or giving drivers access to the HOV lane.

The idea, O’Sullivan said, is to offer toll authorities a way to reduce capital expenditure by up to 20 times by not using large gantry-based infrastructure systems. And it has paid off.

O’Sullivan says Carma is profitable, although pursuing this lawsuit will cut into its bottom line. Still, he said it’s worth the cost.

“I think there’s a danger in society where we can’t rely on our patents to protect the rights of the inventors, and the patent system exists specifically to protect the rights of investors, not to reward copycats that just happen to have deeper pockets,” he said, pointing to Uber’s attempts at its own patents and the rejection of them by the USPTO.

“We think it’s something that’s important to recognize that the rights of a relatively small inventor are being trampled upon. But it’s not just for Carma, really. We think of this as a problem for the entire system. It’s a test of whether the rule of law still applies when a powerful tech giant is involved.”"
Technical,"On May 6,WhatsApp scored a major victory against NSO Groupwhen a jury ordered the infamous spyware maker to pay more than $167 million in damages to the Meta-owned company.

The ruling concluded a legal battle spanning more than five years, which started in October 2019 whenWhatsApp accused NSO Groupof hacking more than 1,400 of its users by taking advantage of a vulnerability in the chat app’saudio-calling functionality.

The verdict came after a weeklong jury trial that featured several testimonies, including NSO Group’s CEO Yaron Shohat and WhatsApp employees who responded and investigated the incident.

Even before the trial began, the case had unearthed several revelations, including that NSO Grouphad cut off 10 of its government customersfor abusing its Pegasus spyware,the locations of 1,223 of the victimsof the spyware campaign, and the names of three of the spyware maker’s customers: Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan.

TechCrunch read more than 1,000 pages of court transcripts of the trial’s hearings. We have highlighted the most interesting facts and revelations below.

Thezero-click attack, which means the spyware required no interaction from the target, “worked by placing a fake WhatsApp phone call to the target,” as WhatsApp’s lawyer Antonio Perez said during the trial. The lawyer explained that NSO Group had built what it called the “WhatsApp Installation Server,” a special machine designed to send malicious messages across WhatsApp’s infrastructure mimicking real messages.

“Once received, those messages would trigger the user’s phone to reach out to a third server and download the Pegasus spyware. The only thing they needed to make this happen was the phone number,” said Perez.

NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli testified that “any zero-click solution whatsoever is a significant milestone for Pegasus.”

Following the spyware attack, WhatsApp filed its lawsuit against NSO Group in November 2019. Despite the active legal challenge, the spyware maker kept targeting the chat app’s users, according to NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli.

Gazneli said that “Erised,” the codename for one of the versions of the WhatsApp zero-click vector, was in use from late 2019 up to May 2020. The other versions were called “Eden” and “Heaven,” and the three were collectively known as “Hummingbird.”

For years, NSO Group has claimed that its spyware cannot be used against American phone numbers, meaning any cell number that starts with the +1 country code.

In 2022,The New York Times first reportedthat the company did “attack” a U.S. phone but it was part of a test for the FBI.

NSO Group’s lawyer Joe Akrotirianakis confirmed this, saying the “single exception” to Pegasus not being able to target +1 numbers “was a specially configured version of Pegasus to be used in demonstration to potential U.S. government customers.”

The FBIreportedly chosenot to deploy Pegasus following its test.

NSO’s CEO Shohat explained that Pegasus’ user interface for its government customers does not provide an option to choose which hacking method or technique to use against the targets they are interested in, “because customers don’t care which vector they use, as long as they get the intelligence they need.”

In other words, it’s the Pegasus system in the backend that picks out which hacking technology, known as anexploit, to use each time the spyware targets an individual.

Shohat disclosed a small but notable detail: NSO Group and its parent company, Q Cyber, have a combined number of employees totaling between 350 and 380. Around 50 of these employees work for Q Cyber.

In a funny coincidence, NSO Group’sheadquartersin Herzliya, a suburb of Tel Aviv in Israel, is in the same buildingas Apple, whose iPhone customers are also frequently targeted by NSO’s Pegasus spyware. Shohat said NSO occupies the top five floors and Apple occupies the remainder of the 14-floor building.

“We share the same elevator when we go up,” Shohat said during testimony.

The fact that NSO Group’s headquarters are openly advertised is somewhat interesting on its own. Other companies that develop spyware or zero-days likethe Barcelona-based Variston, whichshuttered in February, was located in a co-working space while claiming on its official website to be located somewhere else.

During their testimony, an NSO Group employee revealed how much the company charged European customers to access its Pegasus spyware between 2018 and 2020, saying the “standard price” is $7 million, plus an additional $1 million or so for “covert vectors.”

These new details were included in a court document without the full context of the testimony, but offers an idea of how much advanced spyware like Pegasus can cost paying governments. While not explicitly defined, “covert vectors” likely refer to stealthy techniques used to plant the spyware on the target phone, such as azero-click exploit, where a Pegasus operator doesn’t need the victim to interact with a message or click a link to get hacked.

Theprices of spyware and zero-days can vary dependingon several factors: the customer, given that some spyware makers charge more when selling to countries like Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, for example; the number of concurrent targets that the customer can spy on at any given time; and feature add-ons, such as zero-click capabilities.

All of these factors could explain why a European customer would pay $7 million in 2019,while Saudi Arabia reportedly paid $55 millionandMexico paid $61 millionover the span of several years.

During the trial, Shohat answered questions about the company’s finances, some of which were disclosed in depositions ahead of the trial. These details were brought up in connection with how much in damages the spyware maker should pay to WhatsApp.

According to Shohat and documents provided by NSO Group, the spyware maker lost $9 million in 2023 and $12 million in 2024. The company also revealed it had $8.8 million in its bank account as of 2023, and $5.1 million in the bank as of 2024. Nowadays, the company burns through around $10 million each month, mostly to cover the salaries of its employees.

Also, it was revealed that Q Cyber had around $3.2 million in the bank both in 2023 and 2024.

During the trial, NSO revealed its research and development unit — responsible for finding vulnerabilities in software and figuring out how to exploit them — spent some $52 million in expenses during 2023, and $59 million in 2024. Shohat also said that NSO Group’s customers pay “somewhere in the range” between $3 million and “ten times that” for access to its Pegasus spyware.

Factoring in these numbers, the spyware maker was hoping to get away with paying little or no damages.

“To be honest, I don’t think we’re able to pay anything. We are struggling to keep our head above water,” Shohat said during his testimony. “We’re committing to my [chief financial officer] just to prioritize expenses and to make sure that we have enough money to meet our commitments, and obviously on a weekly basis.”

Technical,"Elon Musk has officially announced he’s stepping downas a U.S. special government employee and the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE.

The move follows Musk’s cooling relationship with the Trump administration andslumping Tesla salestied to his political advocacy. Despite his announced departure, Musk gave a shout-out to President Trump for the chance to tackle government waste, and he insisted that DOGE’s mission isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Since launching, the organization has already slashed budgets across agencies, cut jobs, shut down departments, and stirred up plenty of controversy along the way.

Today, on TechCrunch’sEquitypodcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha unpack who else is departing DOGE, and why Silicon Valley’s relationship with politics is entering, as Kirsten put it, the “find out” stage.

Technical,"The White House is investigating after one or more people reportedly accessed the contacts from the personal phone of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and used the information to contact other top officials and impersonate her.

Wiles reportedly told people that her phone was hacked. The Wall Street Journalfirst reportedthe hack of Wiles’ phone. CBS Newsalso confirmedthe reporting.

The hacker or hackers are said to have accessed Wiles’ phone contacts, including the phone numbers of other top U.S. officials and influential individuals. The WSJ reports some contacts received phone calls impersonating Wiles, which used AI to impersonate her voice and sent text messages from a number not associated with Wiles.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly would not say, when asked by TechCrunch, if authorities had determined if a cloud account associated with Wiles’ personal device was compromised, or if Wiles’ phone was targeted by a more advanced cyberattack, such as one that involves the use of government-grade spyware.

In response, the White House said it “takes the cybersecurity of all staff very seriously, and this matter continues to be investigated.”

This is the second time Wiles has been targeted by hackers. In 2024,The Washington Postreported that Iranian hackers had attempted to compromise Wiles’ personal email account. The Journal said Friday, citing sources, the hackers were in fact successful in breaking into her email and obtained a dossier on [Vice President] JD Vance, then Trump’s running mate.

This is the latest cybersecurity incident to beset the Trump administration in the months since taking office.

In March, former White House top national security adviser Michael Waltzmistakenly added a journalistto a Signal group of top White House officials, including Vance and Wiles, which included discussions of a planned military air-strike in Yemen.

Reports later revealed that the government officials wereusing a Signal clone app called TeleMessage, which was designed to keep a copy of messages for government archiving. TeleMessage wassubsequently hacked on at least two occasions, revealing thecontents of its users’ private messages."
Technical,"X’s new DM feature, XChat, has begun rolling out to beta testers. Some X users who pay for the platform’s subscription product have reported that they can access XChat, while reverse engineerNima Owjiconfirmed to TechCrunch that the new messaging system appears to be ready to ship.

XChat is intended to be a more robust version of X’s existing DM (direct messages) feature, which is a holdover from before Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

Some features that have been rumored to be part of XChat include group messages, end-to-end encryption, vanishing mode, the ability to mark messages as unread, and file sharing. Messages also appear to be secured behind a four-digit passcode.

Xannouncedon Thursday that it was pausing work on its encrypted DM feature, which could be related to the impending release of XChat, since this new system would render the existing DM interface obsolete. Paid subscribers on X have had access to alimited versionof encrypted messaging for two years.

In the years since he bought Twitter, Musk has spoken onnumerousoccasionsabout his ambitions to make a Signal-like messaging service embedded into X. If XChat really is gearing up for public use, then this news could represent Musk’s follow-through on that goal."
Technical,"Google’s AI assistant, Gemini, is gaining a more prominent place in your inbox with the launch of email summary cards, which will appear at the top of your emails. The companyannouncedThursday that users no longer have to tap an option to summarize an email with AI. Instead, the AI will now automatically summarize the content when needed, without requiring user interaction.

When Gemini launched in the side panel of Gmail last year, one of the features allowed users to summarize their long email threads, along with other tools like those to draft email messages or see suggested responses, among other things.

Now, Google is putting the AI to work on your inbox, whether or not it’s something you want to use.

The update is another example of how AI is quickly infiltrating the software and services people use the most, even though AI summariesaren’t always reliable. When Apple rolled out AI summaries for app push notifications, for example, the BBC found the feature made repeated mistakes when summarizing news headlines. Apple ended uppausing the AI summariesfor news apps.

Google’sown AI Overviews feature for Search hasalso repeatedly mademistakes, offering poor quality and inaccurate information at times.

With the new email summary cards, Gemini will list a longer email’s key points and will then continue to update that synopsis as replies arrive.

The feature won’t replace the option to manually click a button to summarize an email, Google notes. That will still appear as a chip at the top of the email and in Gmail’s Gemini side panel.

The feature is initially available only for emails in English.

Depending on your region, the summary cards may beturned onor off by default. (For instance, smart features are turned off in the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, and Japan, Google’s help documentation notes.) Others can choose toenable or disable the featurefrom Gmail’s Settings under “Smart features.” Workplace admins can also opt to disable the personalization settings for users from the Admin console."

Technical,"Elon Musk reportedly increased his drug use during the 2024 presidential campaign in which he donated around $270 million to help elect Donald Trump, according to sources who spoke toThe New York Times.

The Times reports that over the course of last year, his drug consumption went beyond recreational use. He reportedly carried a medication box with 20 pills, which included Adderall. Sources told the outlet that his use of ketamine was so rampant that it affected his bladder.

Musk’s use of drugs like ketamine, psychedelic mushrooms, and ecstasy iswell-documentedand reportedly a source of concern for board members at the numerous companies he runs, like Tesla and SpaceX. The latter is a large government contractor and must maintain a drug-free workplace. The Times report claims Musk received advanced notice of drug tests.

It’s not clear if his erratic behavior, like insulting cabinet members,doing the Nazi salute, andjumbled speechduring earnings calls and other events were directly correlated to his reported drug-taking.

The report also details how Musk’s increasing embrace of right-wing politics coincided with family troubles, like his custody battle with the musician Grimes over their five-year-old son, known as X.

Musk announced this week that he wasending his stintwith the government and stepping back from politics to focus on his businesses. He is scheduled to give a joint press conference with President Trump on Friday afternoon."
Technical,"It appears the Trump administration has imposed new export controls on chip design software as it seeks to furtherundermine China’s ability to make and use advanced AI chips.

Siemens EDA, Cadence Design Systems, and Synopsys all confirmed that they have received notices from the U.S. Commerce Department about new export controls on electronic automation design (EDA) software to China.

EDA tools are primarily used to aid with the design and validation of semiconductor manufacturing and testing, as well as for monitoring performance and quality. They are used by chip foundries, chipmakers, networking hardware companies, the automotive industry, and many more.

Siemens EDA, a division of German tech conglomerate Siemens, told TechCrunch that it has received a notice from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) last week about new export controls on EDA software to China and Chinese military end users.

“Siemens has supported customers in China for more than 150 years and will continue to work with our customers globally to mitigate the impact of these new restrictions while operating in compliance with applicable national export control regimes,” the company said.

U.S.-based Synopsys, which also makes EDA software,saidon Thursday that it had also received a similar letter from the BIS. The company also suspended its forecast for the third quarter and full-year 2025.

Cadence alsoreceiveda notice from the BIS saying a license is now required for “the export, re-export or in-country transfer of electronic design automation software” to customers in China.

The news was firstreportedby The Financial Times.

The new export rules come as the U.S. ramps up its efforts to hinder Chinese companies as the battle for AI supremacy heats up. But these export controls are increasingly hurting the U.S. chip industry, which has long enjoyed significant market share in China.

Nvidia alone hasincurred billions in lossesdue to restrictions on sales of its H20 and Hopper AI chips to Chinese customers. The company, along with rival AMD, is evensaid to beworking on selling lower-powered versions of its AI chips to Chinese customers.

The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours."
Technical,"Misfits Market, the online platform that delivers imperfect groceries to help minimize waste, announced the acquisition ofhousehold restocking serviceThe Roundson Friday.

As a result of the deal, Misfits Market plans to take on over 250 items from The Rounds’ inventory. This allows the company to diversify into additional categories, such as household items, including cleaning supplies and paper products.

In a bid to transition The Rounds customers to Misfits Market, the company is offering a $30 credit, along with a complimentary one-year subscription to its new Misfits+ membership, which includes exclusive weekly deals and free shipping.

The company declined to disclose the terms of the deal. It also couldn’t confirm whether layoffs would be part of the acquisition, as decisions are still being finalized. The Rounds has raised a total of $66 million from investors such as Andrew Chen (Andreessen Horowitz), Annie Kadavy (Redpoint Ventures), Construct Capital, and First Round Capital.

Along with diversifying its offerings, the deal will allow Misfits Market to collaborate with former partners from The Rounds, including major multifamily operators such as AvalonBay, Greystar, and Related.

Misfits Market also aims to gain a stronger foothold in the industry as a result of the deal. Notably, the company will continue to pursue M&A as part of a broader growth strategy, especially at a time when consumer awareness of food waste and sustainability is on the rise.

“This market is ripe for consolidation, and we are constantly looking at deals,” Misfits Market CEO Abhi Ramesh told TechCrunch.

This marks Misfits Market’s second acquisition, following its purchase ofImperfect Foodsin 2022, another competitor in the market.

Misfits Market, founded in 2018, offers produce that has been rejected by farmers and suppliers for being considered too “ugly” to sell in grocery stores, often due to being too small, oddly shaped, or having discoloration.

The Rounds, meanwhile, has offered its sustainable grocery delivery service since 2019 that refills home essentials using reusable packaging.

To date, Misfits Market has rescued more than 238 million pounds of food, according to the company. The Rounds has savedover 1 million poundsof packaging waste and estimates to save an average of 500,000 pounds of food each week."
Technical,"AI tools are touted as capable helpers that can easily help you research, code, summarize, write and bring you knowledge of any kind. But sometimes simple questions befuddle them.Google’s AI Overviews, for example, is confused what year it is.Several users reported over the past few days that when they asked Google what year it is, AI Overviews said the current year is 2024.

This reporter got the same answer on Thursday morning when Google was asked if it’s 2025 right now.

Google finally fixed the bug late on Thursday.

When asked why this happened, Google didn’t provide a particular reason, only saying that it was working on an update to avoid such issues.

“As with all Search features, we rigorously make improvements and use examples like this to update our systems. The vast majority of AI Overviews provide helpful, factual information, and we’re actively working on an update to address this type of issue,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

Google has been working on AI Overviews for a few years now, and the feature has so far madesome notable blunders— to name just a couple, it has recommended users eat“one small rock per day,”saying rocks are a good source of vitamins and minerals, and even suggestedadding glue in order to help cheese stick to a pizza. When the company rolled out the feature in Hindi in India, TechCrunch found thatits answers were often inconsistent and confusing.

In recent weeks, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has touted usage numbers for AI Overviews, saying thatthe feature is now being used by 1.5 billion users in over 100 countries. He also added that in markets like the U.S. and India, the feature is driving over 10% usage of the search engine for related queries. The company is betting a lot on driving people to use itsAI-powered search and Q&A features more."
Technical,"Grammarly has secured a $1 billion commitment from General Catalyst. The 16-year-old writing assistant startup will use the new funds for its sales and marketing efforts, freeing up existing capital to make strategic acquisitions.

Unlike a traditional venture round, General Catalyst will not receive an equity stake in the company in return for the investment. Instead, Grammarly will repay the capital along with a fixed, capped percentage of revenue it generates from the use of General Catalyst’s funds.

The investment comes from General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund (CVF), a capital pool that helps late-stage startups with predictable revenue streams deploy new funding specifically to growing their businesses. CVF’s alternative financing strategy essentially “lends” capital that is secured by a company’s recurring revenue.

For companies like Grammarly, this form of financing is advantageous because it’s nondilutive and does not reset the company’s valuation. Grammarly was valuedat $13 billion in 2021, during the peak of the ZIRP (zero interest-rate policy) era. However, the company’s valuation in today’s market is significantly lower, according to an investor in the company who asked to remain anonymous.

Grammarly didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In December, Grammarly acquired productivitystartup Codaand appointed its CEO, Shishir Mehrotra, to lead Grammarly. The company, which is evolving into an AI productivity tool following the acquisition, has annual revenue ofover $700 million.

General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund has provided funding tonearly 50 companies, including insurtech Lemonade and telehealth platform Ro. CVF maintains its own distinct limited partners and was not included in the firm’s recent$8 billion capitalraise.

General Catalyst head honcho Hemant Taneja and Pranav Singhvi, co-head of CVF, talked with TechCrunch in greater length about the group’s specialized financing strategylast fall."

Technical,"AI dev platformHugging Facecontinued its push into robotics on Thursday with the release of two new humanoid robots.

The company announced a pair of open source robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini. HopeJR is a full-size humanoid robot that has 66 actuated degrees of freedom, or 66 independent movements, including the ability to walk and move its arms. Reachy Mini is a desktop unit that can move its head, talk, listen, and be used to test AI apps.

Hugging Face doesn’t have an exact timeline for shipping these robots. The company’s co-founder and CEO, Clem Delangue, told TechCrunch over email that they expect to start shipping at least the first few units by the end of the year, and the waitlist is currently open.

Hugging Face estimates that the HopeJR will cost around $3,000 per unit and the Reachy Mini will cost around $250 to $300, depending on tariffs.

“The important aspect is that these robots are open source, so anyone can assemble, rebuild, [and] understand how they work, and [that they’re] affordable, so that robotics doesn’t get dominated by just a few big players with dangerous black-box systems,” Delangue said via email.

This robot release was made possible in part by the company’s acquisition of humanoid robotics startupPollen Robotics, which was announced in April, according to Delangue. He added that the Pollen team gave Hugging Face “new capabilities” required to make these bots.

Hugging Face has been making a concerted push into the robotics industry over the past few years. It launchedLeRobot, a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools to build robotics systems, in 2024.

So far in 2025, the company has released an updated version of its 3D-printed and programmable robotic arm,the SO-101, which the company built in a partnership with French robotics firm The Robot Studio. It alsoexpanded the training data on its LeRobot platform, through a partnership with AI startup Yaak, to include training data for self-driving machines."
Technical,"Black Forest Labs, the AI startup whose models once powered theimage generation features of X’s Grok chatbot, on Thursday released a new suite of image-generating models — some of which can both createandedit pics.

The most capable of the models in the new family, called Flux.1 Kontext, can be prompted with text and, optionally, a reference image to create new images, writes Black Forest Labs in ablog post.

“The Flux.1 Kontext models deliver state-of-the-art image generation results with strong prompt following, photorealistic rendering, and competitive typography — all at inference speeds up to 8x faster than current leading models,” the company writes in its post.

Flux.1 Kontext comes as the race to build competitive image generators heats up. Google debuted its latest image-generating model,Imagen 4, earlier this month at the company’s I/O developer conference. Earlier this year, OpenAI brought avastly improvedimage-generating model to ChatGPT — a model that quickly went viral for its ability to create art in the style of Studio Ghibli movies.

There are two models in the Flux.1 Kontext family: Flux.1 Kontex [pro] and Flux.1 Kontex [max]. The former allows users to generate an image and refine it through multiple “turns,” all while preserving the characters and styles in the images. Flux.1 Kontex [max] focuses on speed, consistency, and adherence to prompts.

Unlike some of Black Forest Labs’ previous models, Flux.1 Kontex [pro] and Flux.1 Kontex [max] can’t be downloaded for offline use. However, Black Forest Labs is making an “open” Kontext model, Flux.1 Kontext [dev], available in private beta for research and safety testing.

Black Forest Labs is also launching a model playground that allows users to try its models without having to sign up for a third-party service. New users get 200 credits, enough to generate around 12 images with Flux.1 Kontex [pro].

Technical,"Tinder is leaning into dating apps’ reputation for superficiality with the launch of a new feature that lets paid subscribers add their height preferences to their profiles.

After a Reddit userposted a photoof the new height setting in the Tinder app, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the discovery setting has been launched as a global test.

Tinder Gold and Premium subscribers in the test group will have access to the feature, but not free users, we’re told. In addition, the setting will indicate a preference, rather than functioning as a “hard filter,” the company says. That means it won’t actually block or exclude profiles but instead inform recommendations.

“We’re always listening to what matters most to our Tinder users — and testing the paid height preference is a great example of how we’re building with urgency, clarity, and focus,” said Phil Price Fry, VP Comms at Tinder, in an emailed statement. “This is part of a broader effort to help people connect more intentionally on Tinder. Our new product principles guide every decision, and this one speaks directly to a few: prioritizing user outcomes, moving fast, and learning quickly. Not every test becomes a permanent feature, but every test helps us learn how we can deliver smarter, more relevant experiences and push the category forward.”

While typically dating apps let users filter for people by more traditional concerns, like someone’s age or whether they want a long-term relationship or kids, the height setting is likely to cause more controversy and concern.

Since the rise of online dating, a focus on someone’s physicality — like their looks or size — has become a primary factor in determining who’s worth a match. Tinder helped accelerate this trend thanks to its user interface, which puts a heavy emphasis on looking through people’s photos. Other Tinder users often quickly react to those photos with left or right swipes to indicate interest.

In addition to exposing people’s preferences for the conventionally attractive, dating apps’ popularity led to a culture where abias toward taller menbecame the norm. It’snot uncommon to come across profileswhere women state they’re only looking for matches who are at least 6 feet tall, for instance — even if in real life they’d be more flexible about this requirement.

Tinder has even poked fun at this trend in previous years, like when it made an April Fools’ Dayannouncementthat it wouldintroducea “height verification” feature in its app. (Many mendidn’t findthis particular joke funny.) The height bias has also been the subject of other parodies, like whendesigner Soren Iverson imagineda version of Tinder that let men override users’ height requirements for a fee.

The company may hope that the addition of a height setting could encourage more women to use and pay for the app, which tends to be more heavilydominated by men both in the U.S.andinternationally.

The test’s launch follows Tinder parent Match’s recent earnings, whichrevealed a 5% fall in paying users. Paid subscribers across Match’s dating apps fell to 14.2 million in the first quarter, down from 14.9 million users a year ago. The company is in the middle ofanother CEO transition, with Match CEO Spencer Rascoff set to run Tinder too later this summer."
Technical,"Delaware’s attorney general is hiring an investment bank to advise onOpenAI’s for-profit conversion, the Wall Street Journalreportedon Wednesday. The independent evaluation could prolong the transition, or gum up OpenAI’s plans even further.

OpenAI’s conversion will help it attract new investment andeventually go public, but first, the startup needs to secure approvals from state regulators. Although OpenAI and Microsoft have hired their own investment banks to advise on the deal, Delaware’s attorney general is now seeking an independent evaluation of the equity that OpenAI’s nonprofit will receive.

Regulators seem to be zeroing in on a key factor in OpenAI’s conversion, which could significantly affect the price OpenAI ultimately pays to simplify its structure. Corporate governance experts sayElon Musk may have raised the price of OpenAI’s nonprofitwhen he submitted a $97.4 billion takeover bid for the startup, despite the fact that OpenAI promptly rejected it."
Technical,"Perplexity, the AI-powered search engine gunning for Google, on Thursday releasedPerplexity Labs, a tool for subscribers to Perplexity’s $20-per-month Pro plan that can craft reports, spreadsheets, dashboards, and more.

Perplexity Labs is available on the web, iOS, and Android, and coming soon to Perplexity’s apps for Mac and Windows.

“Perplexity Labs can help you complete a variety of work and personal projects,” Perplexityexplainsin a blog post. “Labs is designed to invest more time — 10 minutes or longer — and leverage additional tools [to accomplish tasks], such as advanced file generation and mini-app creation.”

Labs, which arrives the same day as viral AI agent platformManusreleased a slide deck creation tool, is a part of Perplexity’s effort to broaden beyond its core business of search. Perplexity is currently previewing a web browser,Comet, and recently acquiredRead.vc, a social media network for professionals.

Perplexity Labs, powered by AI, can conduct research and analysis, taking around 10 minutes and using tools like web search, code execution, and chart and image creation to craft reports and visualizations. Labs can create interactive web apps, Perplexity says, and write code to structure data, apply formulas, and create documents.

All files created during a Perplexity Labs workflow — such as charts, images, and code files — are organized in a tab from where they can be viewed or downloaded. “This expanded capability empowers you to develop a broader array of deliverables for your projects,” according to Perplexity’s blog post.

It all sounds good in theory, but AI being an imperfect technology, Labs likely doesn’t always hit the mark. Of course, we’ll reserve judgment until we have a chance to test it.

Perplexity has increasingly invested in corporate-focused functionality, last summerlaunchingan enterprise plan with user management, “internal knowledge search,” and more. The moves could be in part at the behest of the VCs backing Perplexity, who are no doubt eager to see a return sooner than later.

Technical,"Heron Power, the electrical grid-focused startup founded by former Tesla executive Drew Baglino, announced Thursday it has raised $38 million in a Series A funding round.

Heron Poweris developing solid-state transformers, which promise to be more compact and responsive than the century-old analog models. Transformers are key parts of the electrical grid, stepping voltage up and down as it moves through the system.

Heron focuses on so-called medium-voltage transformers, which covers a range of possible applications, from large substations behind fences to the green metal boxes found throughout residential neighborhoods.

Heron Powersaid it’s targeting initial installations in early 2027, and it’s partnering with “major energy and data center developers.”

Technical,"On Thursday, Anduril and Meta announced news that feels like a fairy tale ending for Anduril co-founder Palmer Luckey. The two companies are working together to build extended reality (XR) devices for the U.S. military, Andurilannouncedin a blog post.

“I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey is quoted as saying in the post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.”

This partnership stems from the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) Next program, formerly called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next. IVAS was a massive military contract, with a total $22 billion budget, originally awarded to Microsoft in 2018 intended to develop HoloLens-like AR glasses for soldiers.

But after endless problems, in February the Army strippedmanagement of the program from Microsoft and awarded it to Anduril, with Microsoft staying on as a cloud provider. The intent is to eventually have multiple suppliers of mixed reality glasses for soldiers.

All of this meant that if Luckey’s former employer, Meta, wanted to tap into the potentially lucrative world of military VR/AR/XR headsets, it would need to go through Anduril.

The devices will be based on tech out of Meta’s AR/VR research center Reality Labs, the post says. They’ll use Meta’s Llama AI model, and they will tap into Anduril’s command and control software known as Lattice. The idea is to provide soldiers with a heads-up display of battlefield intelligence in real time.

Luckey is apparently feeling good about this reconciliation. He was, of course,famously firedfrom Facebook in 2017, about three years after Facebook bought his startup Oculus for $2 billion. This came after Luckey was embroiled in a brouhaha over his support for Donald Trump in his 2016 election. Luckey turned around and founded Anduril in 2017, with co-founders Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, and Matt Grimm.

An Anduril spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the product family Meta and Anduril are building is even called EagleEye, which will be an ecosystem of devices.

EagleEye is what Luckey named Anduril’s first imagined headset in Anduril’s pitch deck draft, before his investors convinced him to focus on building software first.

“All of them had worked with me for years via Oculus VR, and when they saw the EagleEye headset in our first Anduril pitch deck draft, they pointed out that it seemed like I was sequencing things irrationally. They believed, correctly, that I was too focused on winning a pissing contest over the future of AR/VR, on proving that I was right and the people who fired me were wrong,”Luckey tweetedin February after winning the IVAS contract.

After Thursday’s news, Luckeyposted on X: “It is pretty cool to have everything at our fingertips for this joint effort – everything I made before Meta acquired Oculus, everything we made together, and everything we did on our own after I was fired.”

And to show that Luckey has really buried the hatchet, he said Anduril has even launched aFacebook page."
Technical,"YouTubeannouncedon Thursday that it’s bringing Google Lens to YouTube Shorts in the coming weeks. With this integration, viewers will soon be able to use Google Lens to search what they see while watching Shorts.

For example, if you’re watching a Short filmed in a location that you’re interested in visiting, you can select a landmark and ask Lens to identify it. From there, you would be able to learn more about the destination’s culture and history.

By integrating Lens into Shorts, YouTube is working to enhance visual search capabilities and give users more ways to discover and search for content in an intuitive and interactive way.

It makes sense for the company to enhance search capabilities for YouTube Shorts viewers by leveraging Google Lens, especially since TikTok and Instagram Reels don’t offer similar functionality.

Once the functionality rolls out, users will be able to try it out by pausing a Short and then selecting the “Lens” option in the top menu. Then they will need to either draw, highlight, or tap on something they want to search. Lens will then provide visual matches and search results overlaid on the Short. Once you’re done with the Short, you can jump back into the content that you were watching.

Users won’t see ads in search results during the beta phase of Lens in Shorts, YouTube says. The Google-owned company also notes that Lens in Shorts isn’t available for Shorts with YouTube Shopping affiliate links or with paid product promotions.

YouTube is starting to roll out the beta to all viewers this week.

Today’s announcement comes as YouTube has been building out Shorts with added capabilities to take on TikTok and Instagram Reels.

In April, YouTubeannounced new upcoming featuresthat are designed to help creators publish engaging short-form videos. Creators will get access to an improved video editor, the ability to generate AI stickers, a feature that syncs content to the beat of a song, enhanced templates, and more."
Technical,"DeepSeek’supdated R1 reasoning AI modelmight be getting the bulk of the AI community’s attention this week. But the Chinese AI lab also released a smaller, “distilled” version of its new R1, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, that DeepSeek claims beats comparably sized models on certain benchmarks.

The smaller updated R1, which was built using theQwen3-8B modelAlibaba launched in May as a foundation, performs better than Google’sGemini 2.5 Flashon AIME 2025, a collection of challenging math questions.

DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B also nearly matches Microsoft’s recently releasedPhi 4 reasoning plusmodel on another math skills test, HMMT.

So-called distilled models like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B are generally less capable than their full-sized counterparts. On the plus side, they’re far less computationally demanding.Accordingto the cloud platform NodeShift, Qwen3-8B requires a GPU with 40GB-80GB of RAM to run (e.g., an Nvidia H100). The full-sized new R1 needsaround a dozen 80GB GPUs.

DeepSeek trained DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B by taking text generated by the updated R1 and using it to fine-tune Qwen3-8B. In a dedicated web page for the model on the AI dev platform Hugging Face, DeepSeek describes DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as “for both academic research on reasoning models and industrial development focused on small-scale models.”

DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is available under a permissive MIT license, meaning it can be used commercially without restriction. Several hosts, includingLM Studio, already offer the model through an API."
Technical,"The U.S. government imposed sanctions on Funnull, a company accused of providing infrastructure for cybercriminals running “pig butchering” crypto scams that have led to $200 million in losses for American victims.

On Thursday, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controlannouncedthe sanctions, saying Funnull is “linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI.” The press release said that the $200 million in losses results in an average loss of $150,000 per victim, but that the numbers “likely underestimate the total losses, as many victims of scams do not report the crime.”

Pig butchering scamsinvolve criminals approaching victims online, often pretending to be interested in a romantic relationship, with the goal of tricking the victims into sending them money to invest in nonexistent crypto projects.

According to the Treasury, Funnull is based in the Philippines and run by Chinese-national Liu Lizhi, who was also sanctioned on Thursday.

Funnull, according to the Treasury, generated domain names for websites on IP addresses it owns, and provided “web design templates to cybercriminals.”

“These services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites, but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down,” the Treasury said.

The FBIreleased an alertthat included more information about these activities.

The Treasury referred tothe Polyfill supply chain attackin its press release, saying Funnell “purchased a repository of code used by web developers and maliciously altered the code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam websites and online gambling sites, some of which are linked to Chinese criminal money laundering operations.”

Those activities are exactly whatresearchers from cybersecurity firm Silent Push accused FUNNULL of carrying out last year. Researchers found that Funnull was responsible for the Polyfill supply chain attack, which was launched to push malware to whoever visited websites that used Polyfill’s code. The goal was to redirect users to a malicious network of casino and online gambling sites, the researchers found.

Zach Edwards, a researcher at Silent Push who worked on the Funnull report last year, told TechCrunch that he was “really glad to see the facts aligned with our suspicions.”

“It’s encouraging that the Treasury has taken actions against the largest pig butchering and money laundering network that exists targeting people in the U.S., but we know that more needs to be done,” said Edwards. “This effort from Funnull is the tip of the iceberg for what is actually going on right now out of China with financial schemes targeting Americans.”

“Global threat actors that are targeting Americans with financial scams need to be held accountable, and doxing the companies they work with and the individuals who run those companies, is an important first step,” he added."
Technical,"Tesla is a business built, in part, on government regulations and incentives, from a Department of Energyloan guaranteein 2009 to the regulatory credits it sells to other automakers, which have drivena thirdof its $32 billion in profits since 2012.

Now, the company’s energy business — a rarebright spotamidfaltering demandfor its EVs — is under assault.

House Republicans passed a reconciliation bill last week that would undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for residential solar installations and for clean energy projects. That bill is now before the Senate.

If the Senate were to pass it with those repeals in tact, it could have a devastating impact on Tesla’s energy division, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter, a 67% increase year-over-year.

With CEOElon Muskclaiming that his time in government has come to an end, Tesla has taken to lobbying legislators on X. There, Tesla Energyappealedto Senate Republicans.

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e,” Tesla posted on X. “This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.”

Today, homeowners qualify for 30% tax credits on new solar installations, while clean energy developers can generally claim the same. Those provisions are currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2032, but House Republicans want to end the credits four years earlier and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage.

Cutting those parts of the law could risk the deployment of 60 gigawatts of capacity annually “to support AI and domestic manufacturing support,” Tesla said.

The Trump administration has made “energy dominance” a key priority, and slowing the deployment of renewable and clean energy puts that goal at risk.

Last year,93%of all new generating capacity in the U.S. was clean energy, mostly solar and grid-scale storage. In the first quarter this year, renewables added 7.4 gigawatts, the second best Q1 ever. Queues for new natural gas turbines stretch for years, while solar farms can generally be completed in 18 months.

Like many residential solar installers, Tesla’s energy business is heavily dependent on tax incentives. Since Republicans have prioritized repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, American solar stocks have taken a beating. This year, Enphase is down 45%, Sunrun has lost a quarter of its share price, and First Solar is off 15%."
Technical,"Just ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, Apple on Thursdayannouncednew figures related to the U.S. App Store’s financial success. The company says its U.S. App Store ecosystem has generated $406 billion in developer billings and sales in 2024 — a figure that’s nearly tripled in size since 2019, when it then generated $142 billion.

Apple also made a point to note that, for 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store, developers paid no commission.

The new figures come from an Apple-funded study conducted by Professor Andrey Fradkin from Boston University Questrom School of Business and economist Dr. Jessica Burley from Analysis Group. Analysis Group has beenworking with Apple for yearsamid growing antitrust scrutiny to create reports and studies that showcase the App Store’s market power in a more favorable light and as a net positive for developers.

In particular, these studies have stressed that only a small sliver of Apple’s developer base even pays Apple commissions, and the majority of those who do so are on a Small Business plan or other programs where their commission is reduced from the standard 30% to 15%.

However, those findings haven’t protected Apple from being forced to open up the App Store to increased competition in the U.S.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogersruled that Apple had violated the court’s order arising from Fortnite maker Epic Games’ lawsuitthat had required Apple to reform its App Store’s policy around external payments. As a result of that ruling, Apple was forced to letdevelopers add links to their app that point to web payment options, where Apple is not allowed to take a commission.

Apple is now in the processof appealingthe ruling.

The years-long fight over App Store commissions has led to increased hostility and disappointment from members of the iOS developer community,who believe thattheir applications are part of the reason for the iPhone’s historical success. Many feel they should be treated with more gratitude for their efforts, and not as a resource to extract money from.

Apple, on the other hand, staunchly believes that the App Store itself is the reason for the developers’ success, as it provides the marketplace that allows consumers to discover new apps and easily pay for the developers’ software and services.

That comes through in Apple’s latest report as well, where Apple notes that earnings for U.S.-based developers have more than doubled over the last five years, while small business developers have seen earnings increase by 76% from 2021 to 2024. (The latter number is not surprising. In 2020,Apple launched its Small Business Programthat reduced commissions for developers making less than $1 million per year. An earnings increase is to be expected.)

Apple also reminds U.S. developers that its App Store allows them to reach a global market of 175 countries and regions, and itprevents billions in fraudulent transactions. Its developer investments include 250,000 APIs,  as part of frameworks like HealthKit, Metal, Core ML, MapKit, and SwiftUI.

Additionally, the new report highlights how much developers are making from the App Store in areas where they don’t have to pay commission.

For instance, Apple says that last year, the U.S. App Store ecosystem facilitated $277 billion in total billings and sales from physical goods and services, $75 billion from in-app advertising, and $53 billion from digital goods and services. It also notes that, since 2019, spending on physical goods and services more than tripled and in-app spending on digital goods and services and in-app advertising more than doubled. General retail spending and grocery delivery increased more than fourfold."
Technical,"Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s newest AI model, anupdated versionof the company’sR1 reasoning model, achieves impressive scores on benchmarks for coding, math, and general knowledge, nearly surpassing OpenAI’s flagship o3. But the upgraded R1, also known as “R1-0528,” might also be less willing to answer contentious questions, in particular questions about topics the Chinese government considers to be controversial.

That’s according to testing conducted by the pseudonymous developer behindSpeechMap, a platform to compare how different models treat sensitive and controversial subjects. The developer, who goes by the username “xlr8harder” on X, claims that R1-0528 is “substantially” less permissive of contentious free speech topics than previous DeepSeek releases and is “the most censored DeepSeek model yet for criticism of the Chinese government.”

As Wiredexplainedin a piece from January, models in China are required to follow stringent information controls. A 2023 law forbids models from generating content that “damages the unity of the country and social harmony,” which could be construed as content that counters the government’s historical and political narratives. To comply, Chinese startups often censor their models by either using prompt-level filters or fine-tuning them. Onestudyfound that DeepSeek’s original R1 refuses to answer 85% of questions about subjects deemed by the Chinese government to be politically controversial.

According to xlr8harder, R1-0528 censors answers to questions about topics like the internment camps in China’s Xinjiang region, where more than a million Uyghur Muslims have been arbitrarily detained. While it sometimes criticizes aspects of Chinese government policy — in xlr8harder’s testing, it offered the Xinjiang camps as an example of human rights abuses — the model often gives the Chinese government’s official stance when asked questions directly.

TechCrunch observed this in our brief testing, as well.

China’s openly available AI models, including video-generating models such asMagi-1andKling, have attractedcriticismin the past for censoring topics sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre. In December, Clément Delangue, the CEO of AI dev platform Hugging Face,warnedabout the unintended consequences of Western companies building on top of well-performing, openly licensed Chinese AI."
Technical,"This month, cybersecurity company Thinkst will mark its 10th anniversary since the launch of its now-flagship product, Canary. The company debuted Canary after seeing companies spend millions of dollars on cybersecurity products, yet were still taking months or longer to realize that they had been breached.

Thinkstbelieved it could make a digital tripwire product that would catch hackers in the act, and by all accounts, it did just that.

Over the past decade, the company has grown to around 40 employees, mostly developers and engineers; hasn’t taken on any outside funding; and is on track this year to make a healthy profit on $20 million in annual recurring revenue,almost double from 2021, Thinkst founder Haroon Meer told TechCrunch.

It’s an impressive, if not refreshing feat, at a time when many cybersecurity companies are driven by breakneck growth and speed and fueled by venture capital.

Meer, who founded Thinkst and serves as its chief executive from Cape Town in South Africa, told TechCrunch in a call earlier this month that Thinkst made it this far by focusing on its customers and what they need — specifically a product that does what it says it does — and not growing the company at an uncontrolled rate. Meer said this approach is working, pointing to 60% of its first-year customers who are still with the company today.

“We’re not artificially holding back growth, but we’re also not doing any of the really silly, ‘pour gasoline on the fire’ growth-at-all-costs stuff,” said Meer. “What you have to do is keep the promises that you make, and you’ll grow into the people that are right for you.”

In 2015, Thinkst launched its Canary hardware product — named after acanary in a coal mine, essentially a very early warning system — that can detect and alert when hackers are present on a company’s network.

A canary is set up like a honeypot, so that when a malicious hacker (or anauthorized pen-testerstress-testing a company’s defenses) accesses the canary thinking they struck it lucky by accessing a Windows PC with an open file share, or a server packed with customer data, secret API keys, or a vital service for a company’s operations, the canary will send an alert about the breach and allow the company to take immediate action.

The canary’s purpose is to reduce the amount of time that hackers have to sneak around on a victim’s network to search for sensitive data, plant malware, or otherwise cause damage before getting caught. The average hacker has around 24 days on a victim’s network before detection, according to Verizon’s most recent annual data breach report.

The company also offersCanary Tokens, its free and public offering that lets anyone drop an item of ostensible value, like a password, document, or a credit card number, for example, in a safe place so that when someone accesses or opens the item, you are alerted at the same moment your safe place was compromised.

“One of the things we got accidentally lucky with is it’s really hard to deploy a canary wrong,” said Meer. “If you make it fit in, then you catch attackers, and if you make it stick out, you catch attackers.” After all, if a malicious hacker sees an advantage to get what they need faster, they’re going to take the opportunity.

“It’s rare for us to have a week without getting an email from a customer saying this saved our lives, or we had a pen test and this is the only thing that caught our attackers,” said Meer.

It is these success stories that “fuels” the company, said Meer, and helps drive the company’s organic sales growth. Thinkst does not have an outbound sales team; instead, the company relies largely on word of mouth, or existing customers who want to buy more of the company’s honeypots.

Meer said that while Thinkst hasn’t taken any outside funding to date, he does not begrudge the VC industry and values its insights. While conceding that some companies cannot get to where they are without heavy cash injections, he argues that money is “not the gate that stops you from doing stuff.” Meer said that companies focusing on making their products work and their customers happy is core to good business.

“My main thing is that you should run the business in a way that you are still attractive for investment or acquisition,” said Meer. “If you build a good enough business so that you don’t need it, you can always ask for it when you do.”

Meer was not shy about his company’s ambitions. “We think every company should be running at least five canaries now,” he said. Some companies have a handful of canaries and some into the hundreds or more. “There’s a bunch of stuff that we could do to make more money; we just don’t think that’s necessary right now, because what we’re doing is offering a good product at a fair price, and that’s growing.”

“We are $20 million now, but we don’t think $20 million is our ceiling,” said Meer."

He went on to state that Meta’s plan is to keep building out the AI assistant before creating a business around it. As the assistant gets upgraded over time, Zuckerberg said “there will be opportunities to either insert paid recommendations” or launch “a subscription service so that people can pay to use more compute.”

Technical,"For years, people have been worried — both rightly and otherwise — that electric vehicles could strain the grid to the breaking point. But as they spread, and as EV technology advances, some think theserolling battery packscould become a lifeline for the United States’ aging electrical system.

“In the future, the electric vehicle will be the center of the entire energy grid,” Peter Wilson, co-founder and CEO ofVolteras, told TechCrunch.

The potential is there: Last year, the U.S. installed37.1 gigawatt-hoursof grid-scale energy storage. The country could increase that amount by nearly 10 times if every EV on the road today was hooked up to a charger that can feed electricity back into the grid.

There are a few hurdles, of course. Many new EVs today don’t support vehicle-to-grid connections, though that’s changing, and there’s a lack of affordable bidirectional chargers. ButVolterashas been making headway on the software side.

Recently, the London-based startup closed an $11.1 million Series A led by Union Square Ventures, with participation from Edenred, Exor, Long Journey Ventures, and Wex, Volteras exclusively told TechCrunch.

Volteras is building virtual connective tissue that will allow plugged-in EVs to offer their batteries to support the grid. When massed together, they can serve as virtual power plants, giving utilities quickly dispatchable power that’s distributed across the grid. Along with control over the car’s battery, Volteras also gets access to a host of other connected-car features, like remote unlocking and telematics.

The company integrates with automakers’ own APIs and offers those functions to other companies interested in using them. In the case of a virtual power plant, a utility can pay EV owners to sell some of the car’s stored electricity back to the grid. Car rental services might subscribe, too, so they can remotely unlock vehicles for stranded motorists. Volteras charges those companies a monthly fee per connected car and passes on some of that revenue to automakers.

Several companies are working on similar solutions to smooth the connection of EV batteries to the grid —Texture,EV.energy, andGreenely, to name a few — but Wilson argues that Volteras has a head start because his company is currently working with more than 30 automakers, which include Ford, BMW, Tesla, Stellantis, and Volvo. “We’re going to cover like 90% of the automotive market worldwide by the end of the year,” he said.

Automakers have been salivating over the financial prospects of connected cars, though progress has been spotty. GM, for example, in 2021set a bold targetfor its subscription services: $25 billion in revenue by the end of the decade. But in itsmost recent annual report, the automaker didn’t offer an update. (Usually when things are going well, companies tell the world about it.)

Wilson still sees potential in connected services, starting with the battery. In addition to virtual power plants, Volteras is courting fleet managers, EV routing apps, and insurers interested in offering usage-based plans.

“This kind of hidden data layer that you don’t see — that’ll be the crux of how companies offer services to you, give you discounts, and make it more affordable to own an electric vehicle,” Wilson said."
Technical,"Nearly two years aftersuing OpenAI and Microsoftfor copyright infringement, The New York Times has agreed to license its editorial content to Amazon to train the tech giant’s AI platforms.

The agreement will “bring Times editorial content to a variety of Amazon customer experiences,” theoutlet saidin a statement. That includes content like news articles, material from NYT Cooking, a site dedicated to food and recipes, and The Athletic, its sports-focused site.

The company also noted that Amazon’s use of The Times’s editorial content could extend to Alexa software on its smart speakers.

“Whenever it makes sense within the consumer experience on Amazon’s products, they will provide direct links to Times products, where readers can get the full Times experience,” Danielle Rhoades Ha, a New York Times spokesperson, told TechCrunch.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it’s the first of such agreements for Amazon. OpenAI has signedmultiple similar deals with publishers, including The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, NewsCorp, Axel Springer, and more.

This is also the first time The Times is agreeing to a generative AI-focused licensing arrangement, and it comes after the outlet accused OpenAI and Microsoft of using millions of articles published by The Times to train their AI models without consent or compensation.

“We have a long-standing approach to ensure that our work is valued appropriately, whether through commercial deals or through the enforcement of our intellectual property rights,” the spokesperson said.

Both OpenAI and Microsoft have rejected allegations of wrongdoing.

Technical,"Zeal Capital Partners announced on Wednesday the close of its second fund, raising $82 million. Limited partners in the fund include Citi Impact Fund, M&T Bank, Wells Fargo, and Spelman College. It hopes to invest in at least 25 early-stage companies, writing check sizes between $1 million and $2.3 million, with 50% of the fund reserved for follow-on investments.

Speaking to TechCrunch, Nasir Qadree,founder and managing partner of Zeal,said Fund II will focus on financial technology, healthcare, and future of work, as its other fund did. It has already invested in at least five companies, including the maternal health platform Seven Starling and the fintech Debbie.

Qadree described the funding environment for Fund II as “undoubtedly challenging” because of macroeconomic uncertainty, LP rebalancing, and tighter allocation windows.

“But these headwinds also sharpened our strategy and reaffirmed the strength of our approach,” Qadree said. “I’m proud to share that over 80% of our limited partners from Zeal Fund I continued with us into Fund II, a signal of deep conviction in our ability to consistently back category-defining companies.”

Black-led and founded funds such as this have been making some sizeable closes lately.

Slauson & Co.announced a $100 millionFund II last September, followed by Illumen Capital, founded by Daryn Dodson, announcing theraise of a $32.75 millionfund in November. This year, Sydney Thomas’ Symphonic Capital announced theraise of a $13.5 millioninaugural fund, while Cherryrock Capital, founded by Stacy Brown-Philpot, announced theraise of its $172 millionFund I.

Some of these funds are general in their mission, while others are more explicit in their target of underrepresented communities, showing that appetite still exists for such funds, despite the pressure from the current U.S. presidential administration, and among those that support it, against anything that could be considered “DEI.”

Overall, Zeal, a more generalist fund founded in 2019, has invested in 40 companies. Fund I announced itsclose at $62.1 millionin 2021."
Technical,"In the construction industry, managers can easily become disconnected from what’s happening on-site. Among the many tasks to juggle are staying apprised of costs, communicating with all stakeholders, and assessing risk related to aspects like contractor billing and performance.

Buildotswants to change all of that through AI and computer vision.

Founded in 2018 by Roy Danon, Aviv Leibovici and Yakir Sudry, the Chicago startup offers a platform that tracks construction progress by processing images captured from 360-degree cameras mounted on managers’ hard hats. The system doesn’t just observe; it also forecasts. Teams can use a chatbot to ask questions about a project’s status, and check a predictive tool that alerts them to possible delay risks or pacing issues that could turn into costly problems.

“It’s transformative for site managers, construction executives, and other stakeholders,” said Danon, Buildots’ CEO, who tells TechCrunch the company’s clients include Intel and around 50 construction firms. “[They’re] able to make informed decisions based on real, measurable data as opposed to information trickling in at different times from different sources and with different levels of reliability.”

To build on its momentum, Buildots has raised $45 million in a Series D funding round led by Qumra Capital, with participation from OG Venture Partners, TLV Partners, Poalim Equity, Future Energy Ventures, and Viola Growth. The new cash brings the company’s total raised to $166 million.

According to Danon, the capital will mainly be used to expand Buildot’s product to “cover more stages of the construction life cycle.” The plan is to use historical data to train AI models to further benchmark — and optimize — construction project performance.

Buildots isn’t the only company applying AI in the construction domain. Others includeBeamUp, which is developing an AI-powered building design platform, andVersatile, which — like Buildots — captures and analyzes data across the construction site to provide a picture of construction progress.

With over 230 employees, Buildots ranks among the larger players in the space — and it’s planning to expand its North American operations this year, with a focus on growing its R&D teams.

“[Our] differentiation is strong due to our operations-focused platform and our approach to performance management in construction,” Danon said. “The funding will accelerate all of [our] initiatives, but more importantly, it validates that the market is ready for the transformation that we’re bringing.”"
Technical,"As Kevin Malone from “The Office”once said, “Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?”

For Julia LeStage and Lisa Le, the creators of a new dating app calledLoveJack, finding love online doesn’t have to feel like filling out a mountain of paperwork. Sometimes, all you need are a few carefully chosen words to spark a connection.

LoveJack profiles look like those on other blind-dating apps, but with a twist. Instead of blurred or hidden profiles, users see five words chosen by potential matches. When users press and hold on their phone screens (the app doesn’t use swiping mechanics), profile pictures are then revealed.

The five words can be anything from personal traits and jokes to current feelings or even random details, such as the ingredients in their lunch sandwich — an entertaining tactic that we saw one beta user try during our testing.

The idea is that the five-word constraint allows users to be creative while also challenging them to be concise and clever, encouraging more witty conversations and moving away from mundane questions like “What do you do for a living?” or overused pickup lines.

LeStage and Le decided to create LoveJack after being frustrated with the way online dating profiles often resemble job resumes — complete with posed photos, filters, and carefully crafted bios that can feel exaggerated.

“This is not LinkedIn. Where has the fun gone?” LeStage told TechCrunch, reflecting a sentiment shared bymany online daters, which may explain why dating giants likeTinderhave faced challenges in recent quarters.

LeStage got the idea while working as a judge for the Webby Awards, which notoriously limits winners to five-word speeches. The app also takes inspiration from The New York Times’popular Wordle game.

She shared with us that when she re-entered the dating scene, apps sucked the fun out of the experience, noting that traditional platforms emphasize superficial judgments based on appearance. So she decided to use the five-word challenge on her dates to spice things up, which helped her realize that people tended to use words that “advertised” their way of thinking.

“It’s the stories behind the words that matter,” LeStage explained. For instance, she spoke with someone who mentioned the word “disco.” When she asked him more about it, she discovered that he had written about the history of disco. “I was like, ‘Well, aren’t you Mr. Interesting?’” she said.

Other standout features include the options to either “Bet On” or “Hold” a match. Betting is similar to liking a profile, but the key difference is that users must place a bet by entering a five-word opening line. This gives the match something interesting to respond to.

Users are limited to a maximum of five matches per day, so they need to be strategic in their choices. This is where LoveJack’s “Hold” feature comes into play, allowing users to bookmark a profile if they’re unsure about someone.

Additionally, the five-word descriptions can be updated every day, adding a social aspect to the app. LoveJack archives all previous entries, allowing users to scroll through everything they’ve written.

“You can see in real time, day to day, how they’re revealing themselves through their five-word updates…Your story is going to change every day, all day, like your mood and the weather,” LeStage added.

In the future, there will also be a premium subscription that will include an “All In” button, the app’s version of a “Super Like,” but in this case, it’ll use all five bets on one person so they can’t match with anyone else for the rest of the day.

When it comes to unmatching someone, LoveJack says it tries to minimize ghosting by requiring users to write a preset message when they set up their profiles. The goodbye note is automatically sent to anyone they unmatch.

Another interesting aspect of LoveJack profiles is that users are encouraged to use fake names to protect their identities. While using pseudonyms on dating platforms is common, it can elicit mixed reactions from users. Some individuals may question the authenticity of potential matches, while others might prefer to keep their personal details private until they become more familiar with the other person.

LoveJack states that it implements a selfie verification process to confirm that the person behind the profile is indeed who they claim to be.

Other safety features include reporting and blocking capabilities, as well as censorship of banned language and explicit photos, and an emergency feature that enables users to contact the police and safety hotlines. (These features were unavailable during our beta testing but are expected to be included in the official version.)

LoveJack is set to launch its iOS app next month. It’ll launch in London first, with plans to roll out to U.S. markets next, including Boston, New York, San Francisco, and others. An Android version of the app will launch in India in late summer.

Technical,"To comply with the U.S.’restrictionson exporting advanced semiconductor technology to China, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will soon begin selling new GPUs made for AI workloads in China, Taiwanese tech publicationDigiTimesreported, citing supply chain sources.

Nvidia plans to sell a stripped-down AI GPU, code-named “B20,” while AMD is looking to target AI workload needs with its new Radeon AI PRO R9700 workstation GPU, DigiTimes reported, adding that the companies will likely start selling these AI chips in China from July.

Earlier this week,Reutersreported that Nvidia is working on a new budget AI chip built on its Blackwell architecture for China that is expected to be priced at $6,500 to $8,000. In comparison, the company sells its H20 GPUs for $10,000 to $12,000 each.

Technical,"Home services in India — whether it is cleaning, dishwashing, or laundry — have traditionally been offline and informally run. This has often resulted in delays and uncertainties for consumers, as well as inconsistent pay and job insecurity for workers. Recently, however, startups havebegun viewing this area as ripe for transformation, leveraging technology to bring predictability, scalability, and structure to the space.

Snabbit, founded last year, is one of the early movers in this arena, enabling customers to book high-frequency home services, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen preparation, through its app, with delivery as fast as 10 minutes. The startup has now raised $19 million in a Series B round led by Lightspeed, with participation from its existing investors Elevation Capital and Nexus Venture Partners, at a post-money valuation of $80 million to expand its presence.

The 15-month-old startup launched its quick-service platform in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, after founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal personally experienced the challenges of finding reliable home services. At one point, Agarwal told TechCrunch, the situation became so difficult that his mother had to fly in from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata to help him find a new domestic worker.

“What stayed with me was that in a world of convenience where you can press a button, and you’ll get a cab, or you’ll get food or groceries, you can even get someone to go out on a date with, but finding someone for a simple service at home was excruciatingly difficult,” he said in an interview.

The startup ran experiments early last year and remained in one micro market in Mumbai for the first 12 months before expanding to seven markets in the city and one in Bengaluru.

Snabbit took a “full-stack approach” to sourcing, screening, training, onboarding, and managing workers, who the startup calls “experts.” Once Snabbit signs them, it has the workers move close to the startup’s demand centers so they can fulfill the company’s promise to provide service in 10 minutes.

Snabbit is not alone in this race, as incumbentUrban Company(backed by storied investors, including Accel, Prosus, and Tiger Global)started a similar experienceon its app earlier this year. However, the company faced criticism due to the initial message it conveyed and the name Insta Maids, which it later corrected and renamed to Insta Help. This did not help convince many, including gig worker unions, though.

Similarly, newer entrants, includingBroomeesandPronto, have also joined the arena recently. The latter even recently attracted Bain Capital Ventures for its seed funding.

“We know that the market is heating up,” he said. “The category is getting exciting, new players are coming in and getting funded. And I think all of it is great for us as long as we keep executing relentlessly.”

The startup charges customers between ₹169 (about $2) and ₹499 (nearly $6) to avail services of up to 240 minutes. The pricing is higher than that of Urban Company’s Insta Help, which starts at ₹49 (50 cents). However, Agarwal said the startup continued to grow and scale even after Urban Company’s foray into the market.

Agarwal hopes to compete with a consistent customer experience using its in-house tech stack that includes an internal CRM tool, a sourcing and screening pipeline, and an eKYC process to better comply with local regulations.

Snabbit currently has over 600 workers on its platform, and each of them covers a median walking distance of 300 meters between two jobs. It has also partnered with the mobility startup Yulu to train and provide e-bikes to its women workers, covering a larger median distance of 800 meters between their jobs. Moreover, Agarwal told TechCrunch that the startup will reduce the median distance for its workers as it scales.

The average ticket size on Snabbit’s platform is between ₹250 and ₹270 (about $3), while its workers completing a 12-hour shift earn “upward” of ₹40,000 ($470) a month. For completing four hours a day on the platform, the workers get over ₹10,000 ($120) a month, Agarwal said, adding that workers are also eligible for bonuses.

Agarwal contends that workers can earn more than the roughly ₹9,000 ($100) that domestic helpers in urban locations are typically paid in the country,per the International Domestic Workers Federation (PDF).

Snabbit also provides personal life insurance, health insurance, and accidental insurance to all its workers, as well as family insurance to those who have been with the startup for some time.

Workplace abuse has also beenquite prevalent for domestic workers in India, as the countrypredominantly lacks protective laws. For such cases, the startup provides an SOS feature on its app that workers can use to call a field operations team, which reaches the location within “five to seven minutes” to help workers in edge situations, the founder said.

Over the last four months, Agarwal stated the startup grew 5x and is currently growing around 20% week-over-week. It plans to expand to over 200 micro markets across metro cities in India within the next nine months by utilizing the fresh capital and hire more employees in its workforce that has nearly 100 people.

That said, several hyperlocal consumer apps have been tried and failed repeatedly. For instance, food deliveries imploded globally in 2023 after the pandemic-led lockdowns eased, but they started facing challenges in the last few months. Even in India, instant food delivery models introduced by quick commerce platforms, includingZeptoandZomato, have struggled. The formerpaused its 10-minute cafe services due to supply constraints, while the latterhalted its 15-minute food delivery servicejust four months after launch, citing “no incrementality in demand.”

The cost of acquiring customers and providing suppliers in their location is expensive and often hard to pay over time. In Snabbit’s case, TechCrunch has learned that the customer acquisition cost is ₹700 ($8), while its average ticket size is about $3.

The startup has onboarded over 25,000 customers so far, and an average customer transacts on the platform at least three times a month, per Agarwal.

“Our retention rates are as good as any consumer internet company, say, a Zepto or Swiggy, would be having,” the executive said.

Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how the startup can retain its customers over time and beat the competition while continuing to scale and expand its market in India.

“Snabbit is transforming home services in India by bringing speed, structure, and trust to a sector that has largely operated informally until now,” said Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, in a prepared statement. “We are excited to join them on this journey and support their mission to transform and scale what was once considered a luxury into a day-to-day necessity.”"
Technical,"Sahil Lavingia haspublished a diaryrecounting his time as a member ofElon Musk’s DOGE workforce. It’s a short read — Lavingia’s DOGE stint lasted just 55 days — but it does provide new details on the temporary government organization formed by President Trump’s executive order.

Lavingia is a well-known name in Silicon Valley, from his days as an early employee of Pinterest to his current gig as founder ofGumroad,a platform where creators can sell their goods. He’s also awell-known seed and angel investor.

He joined DOGE as a software engineer for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in mid-March, he wrote. What stands out from his account is his surprise that the 473,000-employee government agency had strict rules on who could be targeted in a layoff, and he quickly learned that all things at the VA were not as inefficient as he imagined. He also lamented that DOGE itself isn’t a well-oiled machine.

As a volunteer who had a salary of $0, he was immediately tasked with identifying “wasteful” contracts and the people the VA should lay off, he wrote. But he was surprised to discover facets like seniority and the person’s veteran status (this was the VA, after all) determined who could be targeted. Performance could be factored in lower on the list, in Lavingia’s view.

He also describedDOGE’s advisory roleas like a McKinsey management consultant and said DOGE is not responsible for the actions taken by the orgs. “DOGE had no direct authority. The real decisions came from the agency heads appointed by President Trump, who were wise to let DOGE act as the ‘fall guy’ for unpopular decisions,” he says.

This is similar to what Musk was decrying this week to theWashington Post. Musk describedDOGE as Washington, D.C.’s  “whipping boy,”blamed for every unpopular decision.

Lavingia said he joined DOGE after campaigning for Bernie Sanders in 2016 because he dreamed of writing code for the government that helped people at scale. Because his DOGE missives didn’t take much time, he said he worked on projects that interested him, including overhauling the UX of the VA’s already-in-use LLM-based chatbot.

He said he built a fairly long list of stuff in his less-than-two-month stint but didn’t get a chance to do enormous projects, like “improving the UX of veterans’ filing disability claims or automating/speeding up claims processing.”

And, he wrote, “I was never able to get approval to ship anything to production that would actually improve American lives — while also saving money for the American taxpayer.”

He was, however, given permission to open source much of his work. His work included a tool that scanned internal PDFs for terms “related to DEI, gender identity, COVID policies, climate initiatives, WHO partnerships,”he describedon the tool’s page, as well as tools that used LLMs to analyze contracts and a tool for building org charts.

He also made observations about the lack of organization in DOGE itself. “I wondered why there wasn’t a centralized DOGE software engineering playbook with all of our learnings; overall, I was surprised by the lack of knowledge-sharing within DOGE. It seemed like every engineer started from scratch.”

He was unceremoniously axed from DOGE on Day 55 after he discussedhis work there with a reporter from Fast Company. “I got the boot from DOGE,” he wrote. “Soon after publication, my access was revoked without warning.”

In that FC interview, however, he also said working up close with the VA taught him that, while it was slow like a giant enterprise, it still “works.”

“I would say the culture shock is mostly a lot of meetings, not a lot of decisions,” he says. “But honestly, it’s kind of fine — because the government works. It’s not as inefficient as I was expecting, to be honest. I was hoping for more easy wins.”

His experience captures perfectly the dilemma of keeping enormous government agencies modern as they remain functional. While all taxpayers would like less waste, and the government can surely benefit from more programmers immersed in the latest tech, perhaps Silicon Valley volunteers swooping in like they are building a startup from scratch isn’t the answer.

Technical,"Horizon3.ai, a cybersecurity startup that provides tools like autonomous penetration testing, is seeking to raise $100 million in a new funding round and has locked down at least $73 million, the company revealed inan SEC filingthis week.

NEA led the round, according to two people familiar with the deal. One person said that the startup is believed to be valued upward of $750 million, although TechCrunch couldn’t verify whether that valuation is pre- or post-money. Another person believes the company did (or will) sell the whole $100 million, and added that the company is generating about $30 million in annual recurring revenue. Neither Horizon nor NEA responded to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.

With this deal, Horizon3.ai becomes NEA’s second major cybersecurity startup investment in less than a month, following Veza’s $108 million funding round at an$800 million valuationannounced in April.

In August 2023, Horizon3.airaised $40 million in a Series C roundled by Craft Ventures with participation from SignalFire. That round brought the startup’s total fundraising to $78.5 million and was aimed to expand its R&D, channel presence, and team of engineers, co-founder CEO Snehal Antani told TechCrunch at the time.

Founded in 2019, Horizon3.ai comprises a team of former U.S. Special Operations cyber operators, entrepreneurs, and cybersecurity experts. Before launching the startup, Antani served as CTO at Splunk and led teams within the U.S. Military’s Joint Special Operations Command.

With all things AI being deployed across the tech world, AI-powered automated attacks are alsoon the rise. The San Francisco-based startup Horizon3.ai helps protect against such attacks with its autonomous threat detection tools.

Technical,"As Nvidia reports earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which closed on April 28, the company has released numbers on how the Trump administration’s recent chip-export restrictions are affecting business.

Nvidiareported that it incurred a $4.5 billion chargein Q1 due to licensing requirements impacting its ability to sell its H20 AI chip to companies in China. The chipmaker also reported that it was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the quarter due to the restrictions.

When the U.S. licensing requirement was originally announced in April, the companysaid that it expected $5.5 billion in related chargesfor Q1.

Nvidia also said Wednesday that the H20 licensing requirements will result in an $8 billion hit to the company’s revenue in Q2, which is predicted to be around $45 billion — a significant toll.

In the company’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company is currently exploring ways to still compete in China’s AI market but that, for now, it has to take a write-off for its H20 chips.

“China is one of the world’s largest AI markets and a springboard to global success with half of the world’s AI researchers based there; the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally today,” Huang said. “However, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to us. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China. We cannot reduce Hopper further to comply.”

Thecompany has been outspokenagainst the Trump administration’s push to limit the export of U.S.-made AI chips to countries, including China.Huang praisedtheadministration’s recent decision to scrap Joe Biden’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rulethat would have imposed further chip-export restrictions.

DespiteBiden’s chip-export rules not coming to bear, Nvidia is clearly not immune to the Trump administration’s attempt to stifle China’s AI market.

“The question is not whether China will have AI; it already does,” Huang said. “The question is whether one of the world’s largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chip makers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America’s position.”

Co-sponsored by 17 other Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) responded to Trump’s increasing investment in crypto with the “End Crypto Corruption Act.”

“Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,” Senator Merkley said in apress release. “This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government.”

But without support across the aisle, these efforts to mitigate Trump’s ethically suspicious crypto investment are unlikely to gain momentum.

With the U.S. government on its side, bitcoin’s price has jumped to all-time highs in May, breaking the $110,000 mark after falling to around $75,000 in April. Companies likeTesla, Coinbase, and Blockhave already made large bitcoin purchases as a way of growing the company’s assets, with each holding over $1 billion worth of bitcoin.

Now, with its massive bitcoin purchase, GameStop follows in these companies’ footsteps."
Technical,"Three years ago, Stellantis announced it waspairing up with Amazonto create in-car software that would bring a slew of connected products and services to vehicles by 2024 as part of the automaker’s broader plan to generate $22.5 billion annually from software.

That never happened. And now the partnership is “winding down,”Reuters reported. The article also reported that Amazon staff working on the project had been reassigned or left the company, according to unnamed sources.

Stellantis confirmed the Reuters report and told TechCrunch it would be pivoting to an Android-based system.

“Amazon remains a valuable partner for Stellantis, and the companies continue to work together on a range of initiatives,” the automaker said in a statement. For instance, Stellantis will continue to use Amazon Web Services as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Amazon’s Alexa will also continue to be available in Stellantis vehicles.

Stellantis laid out an ambitious plan in December 2021 to have 34 million connected cars on the road by 2030. The pitch was that Stellantis would be setting itself up for a new stream of revenue beyond building and selling vehicles.

Stellantis struck partnerships with BMW, Foxconn, Waymo, and Amazon to reach that target.

The plan to use in-car software to sell passengers and drivers products and subscriptions involved three components.

It started with an underlying electrical and software architecture system that Stellantis dubbed STLA Brain. On top of the Brain, Stellantis would add a “STLA SmartCockpit,” a platform to deliver applications to the driver, such as navigation, voice assistance, an e-commerce marketplace, and payment services, as well as applications that would deliver personalized in-vehicle experiences for the driver and passengers. A third piece involved an automated driving platform called “AutoDrive,” developed with BMW.

Amazon wastapped to help Stellantiswith the STLA SmartCockpit, specifically with technology that would adapt to customers’ behaviors and interests and then deliver personalized services.

Stellantis told TechCrunch it is sticking with its smart cockpit platform. Now it seems Google’s Android-based system, which is used by numerous automakers, is headed to this future software platform."
Technical,"DeepSeek has gone viral.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week afterits chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts(and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques,have led Wall Street analysts—and technologists— to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.

But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?

DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.

AI enthusiastLiang Wenfengco-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.

In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.

From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China,DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.

DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The companyreportedly aggressively recruitsdoctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities.DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science backgroundto help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.

DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.

DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.

DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety.

According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’sLlamaand “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’sGPT-4o.

Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claimsR1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks.

Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.

There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject tobenchmarkingby China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy.

In March,DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March.

In May, DeepSeek released anupdated version of its R1 reasoning AI modelon the developer platform Hugging Face.

If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free.It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest.

The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some expertsdisputethe figures the company has supplied, however.

Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models,developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.

DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has beendescribed as “upending AI”and“over-hyped.”The company’s success was at least in part responsible forcausing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18%in January, and foreliciting a public responsefrom OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers thatDeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters.

Microsoftannounced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saidspending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage”for Meta. In March,OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,”and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek.

During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call,CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,”saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute.

At the same time,some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entirecountriesandgovernments,including South Korea. New York state alsobanned DeepSeek from being used on government devices.

In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing thatMicrosoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeekdue to data security and propaganda concerns.

As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to begrowing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported thatthe U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices.

This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly."
Technical,"Chinese startup DeepSeek has released an updated version of itsR1 reasoning AI modelon thedeveloper platform Hugging Faceafter announcing it in a WeChat message Wednesday morning.

The updated R1, which is under a permissive MIT license, meaning it can be used commercially, is a “minor” upgrade, according to DeepSeek’s WeChat announcement. The Hugging Face repository doesn’t contain a description of the model — only configuration files and weights, the internal components of a model that guide its behavior.

Weighing in at 685 billion parameters in size, the updated R1 is quite hefty. (“Parameters” is synonymous with “weights.”) Without modification, the model likely can’t run on consumer-grade hardware.

DeepSeek rose to prominence earlier this yearfollowing the release of R1, which gave models from OpenAI a run for their money. The startup hasraised the ireof some regulators stateside, who argue that DeepSeek’s technology poses a national security risk."
Technical,"Karat Financial, the companyknown for its credit cards for creators, is launching a creator-focused business banking product. Powered by digital bankGrasshopper, Karat’s banking product is a natural extension of its credit card offering with Visa.

“Six years in, the problem we’re solving is still the same,” co-founder and co-CEO Eric Wei told TechCrunch. “Creators are real businesses, and banks don’t understand them.”

Despite their prominent position in culture, creators still encounter hiccups when doing simple things like applying for a business credit card or opening up a bank account, even when their businesses are booming.

In some cases, Wei has seen creators who make millions of dollars a year get declined when making $100 purchases at department stores. In more ambitious cases, Wei sawWilliam Osman, a creator with over 3 million YouTube subscribers, fail to get the six figures in credit he needed to put on theOpen Sauceconvention.

Karat stepped in, gave Osman the credit, and soon got paid back.

“This was a no-brainer, but a normal institution just does not understand the nature of their business,” Wei said.

To date, Karat has extended $1.5 billion in credit, with the average credit limit per creator at $25,000. But creators needed more financial services beyond the Karat Visa.

“As this business-oriented side of the entire creator industry grows, we’re no longer just working with YouTubers who are like, ‘Oh my God, what are taxes?’” Wei said. “We’re also working with entrepreneurs who are like, ‘Why is this so hard for me to get proper treatment from a bank?’”

For business banking, Karat offers two tiers — one is a free, FDIC-insured business checking account with automated tax planning (most creators are independent contractors, so they have to prepare more intentionally for their tax payments than if they had a more traditional full-time job).

The premium offering costs $20 per month or requires a $35,000 minimum balance, but provides 2% to 3% APY on checking accounts, free wires, and enhanced customer support, with AI bookkeeping coming soon.

“We know creators actually keep a lot of money in their checking account because the industry is so unstable, so we pay meaningful APY on checking, which most banks actually don’t do,” Wei said. “We have to balance that with knowledge on the banking side of working with a banking partner and helping them understand, ‘Oh, these are really valuable creators and customers to bring on.’”

In the future, Karat hopes to continue this trajectory of offering more and more business services for creators that traditional institutions are reluctant to provide. A possible avenue could be offering various types of insurance to creators, including healthcare for their companies.

“We’re basically trying to reconstruct the financial safety net for people who make money themselves,” said Wei."
Technical,"Odyssey, a startup founded by self-driving pioneersOliver CameronandJeff Hawke, has developed an AI model that lets users “interact” with streaming video.

Available on the web in an “early demo,” the model generates and streams video frames every 40 milliseconds. Via basic controls, viewers can explore areas within a video, similar to a 3D-rendered video game.

“Given the current state of the world, an incoming action, and a history of states and actions, the model attempts to predict the next state of the world,”explains Odyssey in a blog post. “Powering this is a new world model, demonstrating capabilities like generating pixels that feel realistic, maintaining spatial consistency, learning actions from video, and outputting coherent video streams for 5 minutes or more.”

A number of startups and Big Tech companies are chasing afterworld models, includingDeepMind, influential AI researcher Fei-Fei Li’sWorld Labs,Microsoft, andDecart. They believe that world models could one day be used to create interactive media, such as games and movies, and run realistic simulations like training environments for robots.

But creatives have mixed feelings about the tech. ArecentWired investigation found that game studios like Activision Blizzard, which has laid off scores of workers, are using AI to cut corners and combat attrition. And a 2024studycommissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimated that over 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI in the coming months.

For its part, Odyssey is pledging to collaborate with creative professionals — not replace them.

“Interactive video … opens the door to entirely new forms of entertainment, where stories can be generated and explored on demand, free from the constraints and costs of traditional production,” writes the company in its blog post. “Over time, we believe everything that is video today — entertainment, ads, education, training, travel, and more — will evolve into interactive video, all powered by Odyssey.”

Odyssey’s demo is a bit rough around the edges, which the company acknowledges in its post. The environments the model generates are blurry and distorted, and unstable in the sense that their layouts don’t always remain the same. Walk forward in one direction for a while or turn around, and the surroundings might suddenly look different.

But the company’s promising to rapidly improve upon the model, which can currently stream video at up to 30 frames per second from clusters of Nvidia H100 GPUs at the cost of $1 to $2 per “user-hour.”

“Looking ahead, we’re researching richer world representations that capture dynamics far more faithfully, while increasing temporal stability and persistent state,” writes Odyssey in its post. “In parallel, we’re expanding the action space from motion to world interaction, learning open actions from large-scale video.”

Odyssey is taking a different approach than many AI labs in the world modeling space. It designed a360-degree, backpack-mounted camera systemto capture real-world landscapes, which Odyssey thinks can serve as a basis for higher-quality models than models trained solely on publicly available data.

To date, Odyssey has raised $27 million from investors, including EQT Ventures, GV, and Air Street Capital. Ed Catmull, one of the co-founders of Pixar and former president of Walt Disney Animation Studios, is on the startup’s board of directors.

Last December, Odysseysaidit was working on software that allows creators to load scenes generated by its models into tools such as Unreal Engine, Blender, and Adobe After Effects so that they can be hand-edited."
Technical,"Spotify on Wednesday announced a handful of new features designed to give podcasts a more prominent position in its app as it battles with Apple and YouTube to become users’ preferred podcast streaming destination.

The company says it will begin recommending podcasts on its Home page and provide a Following feed for staying up-to-date with the latest episodes of your favorite shows. Soon, Spotify will also roll out new tools for podcast creators to recommend content and better engage with their fans in comments.

The changes, while relatively minor, are a part of Spotify’s growing efforts to compete with Apple’s Podcasts app and YouTube. The latter has been investing more heavily in podcasts in recent years. This month, for instance, YouTube launched itsown weekly top podcast listto challenge Spotify and Apple. That chart highlights somemajor differences between the platformsin terms of what YouTube’s video viewers prefer to watch.

Meanwhile, Spotify has also invested in video podcasts,allowing all creators to upload videoandincentivizing them with paymentsfor successful showsthrough its Partner Program.

Despite these efforts, YouTube remains the service to beat in the U.S., at least, where one-third of weekly podcast listeners prefer the Google-owned service to Spotify or Apple.

Spotify says the new podcast recommendations on the Home tab have already started to roll out to global users, and early feedback suggests it’s led to more users engaging with podcasts, saving, and liking shows.

In addition, Spotify is introducing a Following feed that will serve as a dedicated spot where you can see all the latest episodes released by the podcasts you follow, instead of having to search across the app. (To access this feature, you’ll tap on the Podcasts button at the top of the app, then the Following button that appears to its right.)

Podcast creators will soon gain access to a new feature that lets them point to other content they mention in their podcast episode that can also be found on Spotify — including other podcasts, songs, audiobooks, playlists, and more. This will become available over the next few weeks and will be found on the episode page.

In a smaller tweak, creators who participate in the comments of their podcast pages on the app will be able to use emoji reactions to respond to fans.

The company notes that creators are still able to control when comments appear or opt out of showing them on their shows or episode pages via their Spotify for Creators account."
Technical,"Google is celebrating 10 years of Google Photoswith the launch of a redesigned editor. The redesign adds new AI features — Reimagine and Auto Frame — which were previously only available on Pixel devices, bringing the tools into the hands of more users.

The Reimagine feature uses generative AI to transform objects and backgrounds in photos with text prompts. For example, you could ask to replace a gloomy sky in one of your photos with “clear blue skies.”

The Auto Frame feature suggests different ways to frame a photo, whether it’s by cropping, widening, or using generative AI to fill in the blank spaces.

Google says the new editor gives users helpful suggestions and puts all its editing tools in one place. You can use AI-powered suggestions that combine multiple effects for quick edits with the new “AI Enhance” option. For example, you could combine AI effects like image sharpening and object removal.

Or, you can tap specific parts of a photo to get suggested tools for editing that area. For example, Google may suggest that you adjust the lighting or blur the background.

Google notes the redesign will start rolling out globally to Android devices next month, with iOS following later this year.

The tech giant also announced that you can now share albums with QR codes to make it easier for others around you to access an album. You could also print out the codes for a group event, where anyone with the code will be able to view and add photos to the album."
Technical,"Meta wants to grow its retail footprint, Business Insiderreportedon Wednesday.

As Meta continues to invest in wearables, these stores would ideally help Meta boost the sales of hardware like theRay-Ban Meta glassesand the Meta Quest VR headsets. These products may be easier to sell if customers can try them out at a store before buying them.

A retail presence could also help Meta stay in competition with Apple’s future AR and VR endeavors, even though itsVision Proheadset is too costly for most consumers.

Hastings’ appointment adds a veteran Big Tech executive to one of OpenAI’s largest — and youngest — competitors in the AI race. The Netflix co-founder seems likely to help Anthropic grow from a startup into a major company, pulling from his experience sitting on the boards of Netflix, Microsoft, Bloomberg, and Meta.

However, Anthropic notes that Hastings was appointed by its Long-Term Benefit Trust, an independent body at the top of the startup’s corporate governance structure that’s designed to be “financially disinterested.” The Long-Term Benefit Trust can appoint and remove board members, with the ultimate goal of helping Anthropic develop AI for the long-term benefit of humanity.

Hastings joins Anthropic’s existing board members: co-founders Dario and Daniela Amodei; investor Yasmin Razavi; and the CEO of Confluent, Jay Kreps."
Technical,"AMD has acquiredEnosemi, a startup designing custom materials to support silicon photonics product development. The terms of the deal, announced Wednesday, weren’t disclosed.

Silicon photonics uses light — photons — to transmit data, offering a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional electrical communication. AMD and other chipmakers have shown an increasing interest in the tech. Late last year, AMDreportedlyteamed up with several Taiwan startups for a silicon photonics R&D collaboration.

AMD says that its acquisition of Enosemi will “accelerate [its] co-packaged optics innovation for AI systems.”

“As AI models grow larger and more complex, the need for faster, more efficient data movement is accelerating,” Brian Amick, SVP of tech and engineering at AMD, wrote in ablog post. “Enosemi has collaborated with us as an external development partner on photonics, and this acquisition extends that successful relationship. Now, as part of AMD, the team will help us immediately scale our ability to support and develop a variety of photonics and co-packaged optics solutions across next-gen AI systems.”

Enosemi, based in Silicon Valley, builds and ships photonic integrated circuits — microchips containing two or more photonic components that form a functioning circuit. Founded in 2023 by a group of tech entrepreneurs, including Ari Novack and Matthew Streshinsky, both of whom have a background in semiconductor engineering, Enosemi offers products such as optical interconnects, which integrate computing and networking components inside a data center.

Prior to its exit, Enosemi raised $150,000 in VC funding from backers,includingNew Mexico Vintage Fund. The company had 16 employees as of May,according to PitchBook.

Novack’sLinkedIn profilenow lists him as a silicon design engineering fellow at AMD.

Enosemi is AMD’s first acquisition following the company’s massive deal to buy ZT Systems, for which the former originally paid around $4.9 billion. (AMD reached anagreementto sell ZT Systems’ server-manufacturing business for $3 billion earlier this month.)

The company is doubling down on its AI investments; in 2024, AMD’s AI chip revenue reached $5 billion, CEO Lisa Su saidduring an earnings callin February."
Technical,"Tesla’s Cybertruck sales dropped significantly in recent quarters, leading to a rapid buildup of unsold inventory. And it looks like the company is resorting to unconventional storage sites for the excess vehicles.

One such location, perCrains Detroit Business, is a Detroit shopping center that is now in violation of city code for storing dozens of Cybertrucks and other unsold Teslas in its parking lot.

No doubt the parking lot looks like a dystopian graveyard with rows upon rows of shiny silver Cybertrucks taking up space where shoppers once came to visit the now-closed Bed Bath & Beyond and Torrid. The Buffalo Wild Wings in the shopping center, though, is still open.

The lot is near a new Tesla showroom in West Bloomfield, which may account for the overflow. Crain’s reports that the shopping center landlord has been informed of the violation, but enforcement could take some time.

But that Silicon Valley culture continues to seep into policy as tech billionairesexpand their influence in Washington, making these tensions harder to ignore. Elon Musk spent nearly $300 million to elect Donald Trump, and now holds sway over the federal agencies that regulate his businesses and award government contracts. And he’s not alone. Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have also built powerful networks that now reach deep into policymaking circles.

Technical,"Over three and a half years after family locator app Life360acquired lost item tracker Tile for $205 million, the two services are finallyfully integrated. On Wednesday, Life360 announced that the item-finding capabilities of Tile, a competitor to Apple’s AirTag and other Bluetooth-based trackers, are now available from inside its main app.

The update means users will now be able to see where family members are in real time, as well as their valuables, like their wallet, keys, bags, and other items. The change will also help to centralize the separate user bases for the two apps by pushing Tile’s users to adopt the Life360 app as their main tracking tool.

A company representative told TechCrunch that the integrated services will begin rolling out on Wednesday and will reach all users over the next few weeks.

As the rollout progresses, Tile users will soon see a message in their app directing them to Life360, while Life360 users will see a new section for tracking their items below the people and pets section on the Location tab of the app.

Tiles that are with a Life360 family member will also appear on the in-app map in real time. If an item is lost, users can view up to two days of location history for free. Subscription plan users can access longer periods of location history, with Gold and Platinum users able to see 30 days, while Silver members can access the past seven days. Silver members also now have access to emergency dispatch services through the Tile SOS button or the Life360 app. (This works with the 2024 Tile devices only, however.)

In addition, Life360 users will soon be able to receive automatic push notifications when their items attached to Tile devices are left behind. The company says to expect this functionality to arrive in the weeks ahead.

Just ahead of this update, Life360redirectedtheTile.comdomain toLife360.com.

The company hasn’t yet given an indication if or when it plans to wind down the standalone Tile app, and it likely won’t want to make that move until it’s able to migrate users over to its flagship product. But after Tile functionality is fully replicated in Life360’s app, it may no longer make sense to continue to run both applications. (Reached for comment, a spokesperson said the Tile app is not being retired “at this time.”)

Life360 had saidback in2022that it would integrate Tile into its main app, noting at the time that if all its Life360 users joined Tile, it would become the largest finding network. But that opportunity may have passed, given the delay in integrating the services. Plus, competitors likeChipolo have since launched their own lost-item trackersthat work directly with both Apple and Google’s own built-in finding networks out of the box.

Life360 doesn’t share the number of users for its Tile app, but notes that its flagship product has 83.7 million global monthly active users, 45.3 million of whom are based in the U.S."
Technical,"Microsoftannouncedon Wednesday that it has started rolling out the beta version of its Copilot for Gaming experience. Beta testers can access the experience in the Xbox app on iOS and Android.

The early version of the experience allows the assistant to answer questions about the games you’re interested in, give you links to more information, and answer questions based on your account, play history, achievements, and more.

For example, you could ask something like: “What’s my gamer score and can you give me some tips to raise it?” or “I love horror movies. Any suggestions for what game I should play?” As for questions about your play history or account, you could ask something like: “What was the last achievement I got in Starfield?” or “When does my Game Pass subscription renew?”

“In this early version of the feature for mobile, you’ll be able to access Copilot for Gaming on a second screen, without distracting you from your core gameplay experience,” Taylor O’Malley, principal program manager at Xbox, explained in ablog post.

Once you ask Copilot a question, it looks at your player activity on Xbox, alongside public information from Bing, to formulate a response. Microsoft says it’s working to add more personalization and richer game assistance, such as proactive coaching, to Copilot for Gaming.

The beta version of Copilot for Gaming is available in English for players aged 18 and older in the following countries: Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkiye, UAE, Ukraine, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam.

Technical,"Context, a startup building an AI-powered office suite, on Wednesday announced that it raised $11 million in a seed round led by Lux Capital with participation from Qualcomm Ventures and General Catalyst. The round, whichbrings the company’s total raisedto around $15.75 million, values Context at $70 million.

Founder Joseph Semrai, a Thiel Fellow, started working on Context in 2024 after he realized that current digital office suites are not well-suited to take advantage of AI models.

“[W]e have a bunch of disparate applications that aren’t necessarily built keeping the power of [AI models] in mind,” Semrai told TechCrunch in a phone interview. “We want to take advantage of the fact that [models] can understand large context windows and use multiple applications at the same time to get the best result.”

Over the past few years, many startups inthe productivityandbrowsing spacehave made user interface changes to adopt a chat-forward experience, largely thanks to the rise of AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT. Semrai thinks that Context, which is similarly chat-focused, can be a powerful tool for workers using an office suite, similar to how Cursor has become a useful application for programmers.

Office suite makers likeGoogleandMicrosofthave infused AI into their applications. Canva, which has been in the creative space historically, is also designing products that suit all kinds of office work withAI at the center. Notion, meanwhile, is buildingan enterprise workplace with an AI search and research mode.

Many of these products offer connectors to third-party applications. But Semrai said that while connecting to sources and retrieving data is becoming commoditized, new-age tools don’t always deliver capabilities that help with analysis. That, he said, is where Context comes in — it’s designed to make it easier for users to reason over the data they fetch from various sources and make decisions based on that.

Context has a simple interface with a chat box in the center. You can ask the AI tool to perform research derived from your documents, integrations, and web knowledge. You can then ask it to convert all this to a document, spreadsheet, or presentation, while continuing to interact with it to generate different artifacts.

Context also offers a Python interpreter to let you run code.

The goal isn’t necessarily replacing a fully featured office suite like Microsoft 365. Rather, Context is going after a market not well-served by the current crop of tools, according to Semrai. For example, unlike many AI-powered data analysis products, Context will soon be able to work offline, enabling simple analysis and document drafting based on existing data and documents via Context’s desktop client.

“The general ledger is the beating heart of the finance function, and so asking a company to remove it is a kind of open-heart surgery,” said Julien Bek, a partner at Sequoia Capital.

Until a few years ago, Bek believed that VCs wouldn’t dare to invest in startups building new general ledger software. It’s not only difficult to get customers to switch from their existing accounting software, but building a new general ledger business is also very challenging, he explained.

Bek changed his mind when he discoveredRillet, a three-year-old company leveraging machine learning and generative AI to automate accounting reports. Rillet directly pulls data from their customers’ banks and platforms, such as Salesforce, Stripe, Ramp, Brex, and Rippling, to generate essential financial statements, including the balance sheet and income statement.

Rillet founder Nicolas Kopp (pictured above) says thanks to machine learning and AI, his company’s software enables accounting and finance teams at medium-sized companies to close their monthly or quarterly books in hours, a process that previously took weeks. Prior to Rillet, Kopp was U.S. CEO of Europeanneobank N26.

Since launching its product last year, Rillet’s revenue has grown five-fold, and it has brought on nearly 200 customers, including fast-growing companies like Windsurf, the AI coding assistantreportedly sold to OpenAI for $3 billion, and Decagon, an AI customer support startup reportedly valued at $1.6 billion.

In the past, companies of that size would likely have installed NetSuite, general ledger software developed in the late 1990s that is still very popular with middle-sized companies. But NetSuite is slow and clunky.

“I think a third of their deals are coming from [customers] replacing NetSuite, or NetSuite-like systems,” Bek said about Rillet’s customers.

It was this statistic that helped Sequoia decide to invest. “What I was watching for is that they start replacing NetSuite. Because [with] many companies, you can get the small customers, but getting the big ones, I think that’s really hard,” Bek said.

On Wednesday, Rillet said it has raised a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from existing investors. The fresh funding comes 10 months after the company raised a $13.5 million seed and pre-seed round from First Round Capital, Creandum, and Susa Ventures.

Rillet’s AI makes the installation process relatively painless. It used to take many months to transfer all the data from one general ledger software to another; Rillet can reduce that time to about four to six weeks, Kopp said. Clients simply continue to use the existing general ledger platform until they are sure that all the data has moved to Rillet.

According to Kopp, Rillet competes with NetSuite and other legacy platforms, but currently doesn’t have a clear rival that leverages AI and machine learning to replace accounting systems for mid-size companies.Digits, another AI accounting startup, recently launched its autonomously-powered general ledger, but unlike Rillet, it targets small businesses that use QuickBooks and Xero."
Technical,"After the market closes on Wednesday, Nvidia will report earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended on April 27.

While many in the industry are likely eager to hear how the recentwhiplash surrounding U.S. chip export controlswill impact Nvidia’s international chip business and future guidance, not everyone thinks that is the most important piece of Nvidia’s results to pay attention to.

Kevin Cook, a senior equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research who has followed Nvidia for a decade, told TechCrunch he believes the company’s rollout of its new GB200 NVL72 hardware — a single-rack exascale computer that started shipping in February — is a much more important area for shareholders to focus on.

TheseGB200 NVL72 machinesinclude 72 GPUs and cost around $3 million. Cook said that, despite strong demand and high expectations heading into this year, thechaos around DeepSeekin late January sparked manyanalysts to halve their delivery estimates for the unit.

Cook added that, because this is the first quarter the company has shipped the machine, there isn’t yet a clear indicator of how things are going.

“If Jensen [Huang] says we are going to deliver 10,000 units in Q2, the street will be very impressed,” Cook said. “That’s a big doable number; 10,000 is $30 billion on a $3 million product. I think they are going to do less than 5,000.”

Cook added that these results will start to paint a picture of enterprise appetite for the latest AI tech. Will companies upgrade their AI hardware each time a new system comes out, similar to how consumers upgrade to the latest iPhone each year? Cook isn’t sure. Whether or not enterprises will adopt that behavior could have a significant impact on Nvidia down the line.

There will be immediate effects on Nvidia’s stock based on what the company says regarding U.S. export controls, Cook predicted. But he doesn’t think it will impact Nvidia’s valuation or stock price long term in the same way that demand for the GB200 NVL72 might.

Nvidia’s stock price has proven it can recover from short-term market reactions, he added.

“We basically had a flash crash, and it’s right back up,” Cook said regarding Nvidia’s stock price after the chipexport restrictions were announced. “That’s unique to Nvidia. Lots of companies are going to have hiccups, but Nvidia has the biggest moat. They have the most resilience to any of this. It’s such an irony that they could have this issue with China — whether or not they can sell — and it basically gets shrugged off, right?”

Even if chip export restrictions on China remain or become more stringent, Cook argued that Nvidia isn’t struggling to find customers elsewhere. The company currently sells to all the major hyperscalers and will likely continue to see strong demand for its AI chips. He added that the recent announcements regardingStargate’s new project in the Middle Eastwill likely be another win for the company.

For Cook, his guidance really comes down to those GB200 NVL72 units.

“As long as we hear that deliveries are expected to be steady to exceptional, then whatever fluctuations in this quarter’s revenue, I think, are going to be put on the back burner because the wind is in their sails for the rest of the year,” Cook said."
Technical,"Discordannouncedon Wednesday that it’s experimenting with a new virtual reward system aimed at encouraging more users to engage with its interactive ads. This new feature, called “Orbs,” comes on the heels of the company preparing for apotential IPO.

Users can earn Orbs by completing “Quests,” Discord’s ad format where advertisers incentivize users to watch product videos or play games by rewarding them with virtual items. The addition of Orbs gives users the chance to redeem exclusive digital items from Discord’s Shop, including Nitro credits, profile badges, avatar decorations, profile effects, and items from main collections.

It’s clear that the goal of Orbs is to encourage more interaction with Quests as Discord seeks to demonstrate to partners that it can offer a scalable ad business. The company has reportedly discussed a possible IPO with investment bankers, perThe New York Times.

Last month,Peter Sellis, Discord’s senior vice president of product, highlighted the success of Quests. He reported that, over the past year, more than 70 Quests achieved a 10% acceptance rate with millions of rewards earned, according to the company’s internal data.

Quests are located in the bottom left corner of the app on PC. Plans are in place toexpand Quests to mobile devicesin June.

The Orbs experiment may also entice users who don’t have a subscription to try Nitro, as they can spend Orbs on credits instead of using a payment method. For instance, users need 1,400 Orbs to get three free days of Nitro, which typically costs $10 per month.

Orbs is being rolled out to a small group of users and will soon expand globally.

This story was updated to clarify that Quests are not available on gaming consoles."
Technical,"With Apple’s flagship Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event a few weeks away, the company is signaling that it’s paying attention to the opportunity of mobile gaming.

Apple already has a subscription-based Arcade product for iOS, which gives users access to various mobile games, including cult-classic indie games like Stardew Valley. But per a Digital Trends report, the company is taking things a step further byacquiring its first game studio, RAC7, which makes the hit Apple Arcade game Sneaky Sasquatch.

Apple joins some other seemingly unlikely suspects in their investment in mobile gaming — Netflix, for example, acquiredseveral gaming studiosafter launchingNetflix Gamesin 2021, which makes cloud mobile gaming available to Netflix subscribers.

Meanwhile, Bloombergconfirmeda 9to5Macreportthat Apple is developing a dedicated gaming app for iOS 19. The app will reportedly replace the Game Center app and integrate with Apple Arcade to host features like gaming leaderboards, recommendations, challenges, and social features. The new app could also integrate into iMessage or FaceTime to facilitate remote multiplayer gaming.

Apple’s additional investment in mobile gaming comes at a time when cloud gaming — which allows users to stream games to their devices without downloading massive files — is on the rise. Microsoft has been a leader in this shift with its Xbox Cloud Gaming offerings."

Technical,"LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a data broker that collects and uses consumers’ personal data to help its paying corporate customers detect possible risk and fraud, has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 364,000 people.

The company said ina filing with Maine’s attorney generalthat the breach, dating back to December 25, 2024, allowed a hacker to obtain consumers’ sensitive personal data from a third-party platform used by the company for software development.

Jennifer Richman, a spokesperson for LexisNexis, told TechCrunch that an unknown hacker accessed the company’s GitHub account.

The stolen data varies, but includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver license numbers.

It’s not immediately clear what circumstances led to the breach. Richman said LexisNexis received a report on April 1, 2025 “from an unknown third party claiming to have accessed certain information.” The company would not say if it had received a ransom demand from the hacker.

Data brokers like LexisNexis are part of a billion-dollar industry of companies that profit from collecting and selling access to large amounts of Americans’ personal and financial data. LexisNexis uses swathes of consumer information to help companies detect potentially fraudulent transactions, as well as to perform risk assessment and due diligence on would-be customers.

Last year,The New York Timesreported that car manufacturers were among several companies that shared data on vehicle driving habits with LexisNexis without car owners’ explicit permission. The data was then sold on to insurance companies, which used the mileage and driving data to determine the drivers’ insurance premiums.

Law enforcement agencies also use LexisNexis for obtaining personal information on suspects, such asnames, home addresses, and call records.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration scrapped a plan that would haverestricted data brokers from selling Americans’ personal and financial information, including Social Security numbers. White House official Russell Vought wrote in a Federal Register notice that the Biden-era rule, which would have required data brokers to follow the same federal privacy rules as credit bureaus and renter-screening companies, was “not necessary or appropriate,” despite long-standing calls by privacy advocates to close the loophole.

Technical,"Instacart announced on Wednesday that its chief business officer, Chris Rogers, has been appointed as the company’s new CEO. The appointment is effective August 15. Rogers will also join Instacart’s board of directors.

The announcement comes a few weeks after Instacart CEOFidji Simoshared that she’s stepping down tojoin OpenAI as CEO of Applications. Simo will remain chair of the board at Instacart.

In his role as chief business officer, Rogers oversaw Instacart’s retailer relationships and expansions, Ad Sales and R&D, Partnerships, Mergers & Acquisitions, Instacart Business, and Instacart Health.

Rogers joined Instacart in 2019 after nearly 11 years at Apple, where he served as the managing director for Apple Canada. He began his career at Procter & Gamble, where he led relationships with Canada’s largest national grocery retailers, Instacart says.

“Instacart sits at the center of how people shop, eat, and care for their families — and that’s always been what inspires me most about our mission,” Rogers said in apress release. “Together with our partners, we’re transforming the future of grocery shopping, but more importantly, we’re helping people solve real, everyday needs. We have a world-class team, deep partnerships, leading technology, and a bold vision for the future, and I’m honored to step in and lead Instacart’s next chapter.”

In ablog post, Rogers said that Instacart’s vision will remain the same under his leadership, and that the company will continue to focus on its “unwavering commitment to growing the pie for retailers and brands.” He also said that Instacart will work to provide more flexible earnings opportunities for shoppers on its platform.

In a letter to employees, Simo stated that Rogers has played a critical role in shaping Instacart and that she will continue to work with him over the coming months to allow for a smooth transition.

“We chose Chris because the company needs a leader who understands all our partners deeply, has immense operational experience, and can mobilize teams around our vision,” Simo wrote. “Chris knows this company. He helped shape it. And I know Chris will carry our mission forward with conviction, care, and ambition. I couldn’t be more excited for him to step into the role of CEO and lead Instacart’s next phase of growth.”"
Technical,"Tech companies arebetting heavilythat nuclear power can help deliver the electricity they need to realize their AI plans. But data centers need power tomorrow, and the nuclear industry isn’t known for its speed.

Trey Lauderdale thinks AI can give nuclear the speed that it needs.

Lauderdale’s obsession with nuclear started close to home. In San Luis Obispo, California, where he lives, he kept running into people who worked at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “They’re like the coaches of our flag football team,” he said.

In talking with them, he learned that nuclear power plants are swimming in documents. Diablo Canyon has around 2 billion pages’ worth, he said. Lauderdale, a serial healthcare entrepreneur, had a hunch that AI could help the nuclear industry tame its paper problem.

Lauderdale foundedAtomic Canyona little over a year and a half ago, initially funding it with his own money. The startup uses AI to help engineers, maintenance technicians, and compliance officers find the documents they need.

The startup landed a deal with Diablo Canyon in late 2024. Lauderdale said the deal led to inquiries from other nuclear power companies. “That’s when I knew, as an entrepreneur, we were at a point where we needed to raise a round of capital.”

Atomic Canyon closed a $7 million seed round led by Energy Impact Partners, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Participating investors include Commonweal Ventures, Plug and Play Ventures, Tower Research Ventures, Wischoff Ventures, and previous angel investors.

When Atomic Canyon first started, its AI engineers tested various models with underwhelming results. “We quickly realized the AI hallucinates when it sees these nuclear words,” Lauderdale said. “It hasn’t seen enough examples of the acronyms.”

But building a new AI model requires massive computing power. So Lauderdale talked his way into a meeting with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which conducts nuclear research and also happens to have the world’s second-fastest supercomputer. The lab was intrigued by the idea and awarded Atomic Canyon 20,000 GPU hours’ worth of compute.

Atomic Canyon’s models use sentence embedding, which is particularly suited to indexing documents. It tasks them with making a nuclear power plant’s documents searchable using retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. RAG uses large language models to create responses to queries, but it requires the LLMs to refer to specific documents in an effort to reduce hallucination.

For now, Atomic Canyon is sticking to document search, in part because the stakes are lower.

“One of the reasons we’re starting generative work around the titles of documents is because getting that wrong might cause someone a little frustration. It doesn’t put anyone at risk at the plant,” Lauderdale said.

Eventually, Lauderdale envisions Atomic Canyon’s AI creating “a first round draft” of documents, complete with references. “You are always going to have a human in the loop here,” he said.

Lauderdale didn’t put a timeline on that effort, though. Search is “the foundational layer,” he said. “You have to nail the search.” Plus, given the number of documents in the nuclear industry, “we have a long runway in search alone,” he said."
Technical,"Elon Musk’s brain implant startup, Neuralink, has raised $600 million in a funding round that values the company at $9 billion pre-money,Semafor reported, citing anonymous sources.

Semafor did not mention the investors involved in the round. Neuralink lastraised $43 millionin venture capital in November 2023, and was valued at about $5 billion in June 2023, Reutersreportedat the time.

Technical,"All Thibault Launay and his wife, Simi, wanted nearly five years ago was to build a dream home in Portugal, where they both now live.

But what they encountered instead was a broken system. “Fourteen months of delays, 20% budget overruns, and endless stress managing over 10 subcontractors,” Thibault recalled. They bought the land in December 2020, got the construction license in early 2022, and started building that year. “That was supposed to finish in February 2024,” he said. But it’s May 2025, and the home still isn’t done.

“We realized,” he continued, “if we’re struggling with this, so are millions of others.”

So Thibault, himself a serial founder and entrepreneur, and Simi, a consultant and also a founder, launchedLitehaus, a company that touts to help landowners and property developers build homes in a more efficient and sustainable way. It tackles a pressing need in both the U.S. and the European markets: the ability to build affordable homes.

Litehaus, which launched early last year, calls itself the “Uber of construction,” with Thibault saying the company just wants to connect all the currently fragmented parts of the home-building process. It matches landowners and property developers with other professionals such as construction companies, architects, contractors, and interior designers. The company allows users to track costs, coordinate schedules with the hired workers, and track the progress of the building in real time.

“As a go-to-market strategy, we decided to focus mainly on modular construction, allowing us to build 30% cheaper, 40% faster, and 60% more sustainably,” Thibault said, adding that meant 90% less waste and 50% less CO2 emissions compared with traditional construction.

Others in the modular construction space include the U.S.-based Ginosko Modular and Flummerfelt and the India-based Schnelle Prefabs, according to PitchBook.

Litehaus has at least one U.S. construction company in its network as it looks to further its expansion in the country. Right now, it is focused on becoming “Europe’s fastest-growing construction tech startup,” Thibault said.

Plus, the European construction industry could use more innovation. Investors in America pour billions of dollars into rising construction technology, and, as usual, there is much room for the European tech industry to catch up.

Investors here and across the pond clearly agree. Last week, Litehaus announced a €1.46 million pre-seed round, co-led by the U.K.’s Cornerstone VC and Explorer Fund, one of Portugal’s largest private equity funds. Claster Group, a Luxembourgish family office, and angel investor Pascal Levy, a venture partner at Long Journey Ventures here in the U.S., also participated in the round.

“The shortage of housing across Europe has triggered a crisis, driving up the cost of living as home ownership becomes increasingly out of reach,” Rodney Appiah, a managing partner at Cornerstone VC, said. “When I first met Thibault and Simi, I was struck by their compelling vision: to make building a home as simple as buying one, catalyzing the construction industry to bring greater transparency, sustainability, quality, and trust to the home-building process.”

Thibault called the fundraising journey “intense.” He said he and Simi had known their lead investors for years through mutual friends. Thibault, who is from France, is the founder of an immersive gaming studio in Portugal, but he has also invested in numerous companies, both as an angel investor and through his work at firms 50 Partners and Origins, based in France and New York, respectively. Before that, he worked at a French mining company and in green tech.

Simi, meanwhile, was born in Nigeria and grew up in London. She ran a contemporary art gallery, a wellness brand for women of color, and worked as a consultant and strategist for various firms on law and Africa.

“I’ve always wanted to build businesses that change people’s lives,” Simi told TechCrunch. “Providing affordable homes at scale isn’t just a market opportunity — it’s one of the most meaningful ways we can create deep, lasting impact.”

She is now in charge of marketing, communication, and design at Litehaus, while Thibault handles fundraising, business development, and tech.

“When it came time to raise, we moved quickly with partners who already knew us and shared our vision from day one,” Thibault said. He said the fresh capital will be used to help scale the company and hire more talent in engineering, product, marketing, and operations.

It’s quite funny that Thibault and Simi built a company, raised over a million euros, and had two kids, before their home, a process they started working on over four years ago, was finally finished.

“We are actually moving in next month,” Thibault said. “We move in next month after a 14-month delay on completion. This is the pain point we are trying to solve for millions of people.”

Technical,"Opera on Tuesday revealed a new browser, calledOpera Neon, that will focus on AI workflows and performing tasks on your behalf, like shopping, filling out forms, and coding.

The browser is currently behind a waitlist, but the company said users will have to subscribe to use it once it releases. Pricing details were not disclosed.

Notably, Opera Neon browser features three new buttons on its sidebar: Chat, Do, and Make. Chat presents a chatbot interface with which you can search the web, get answers to your queries, and ask for more information about web pages you’re browsing.

Do uses the company’s Browser Operator AI agent, whichwas announced in March. This AI agent is supposedly capable of performing tasks like filling out forms or handling your trip bookings locally in the browser.

The Make option is also notable, as Opera says it can create games, websites, snippets of code, reports, and more with text prompts. The company said the AI workflows that enable this feature are performed through a virtual machine in the cloud, so Neon will work on tasks by itself even if you go offline, and users can run multiple tasks at the same time.

All this sounds great on paper, but suchAI apps often don’t perform as well as they’re said to. Plus, Opera is not the only company working on AI agents for browsers: The Browser Company teased an AI-powered browser last December thataims to have agents do stuff for you, and Google is working on projects thatwill return search results and even perform tasks using AI agents."
Technical,"Humain, the state-owned AI company from Saudi Arabia, is on track to launch a $10 billion venture fund, Humain Ventures, that will invest in startups in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, the Financial Timesreported, quoting Tareq Amin, Humain’s CEO.

Humain is in talks with U.S. firms like Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and Elon Musk’s xAI about its plans and is also exploring a deal with U.S. companies to sell an equity stake in its data center business, the report said.

Amin did not reveal which companies these are but said some are “massive names in the data center segment,” according to the report.

Humain was launched earlier this month ahead of a visit by U.S. president Donald Trump and several tech industry allies. Under anew Trump administration initiative, U.S. tech suppliers, including Nvidia and AMD, have been allowed to arrange deals with Saudi Arabian firms.

So far, Humain has struck deals with Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, andAmazonand plans to have 1.9 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2030. The plan is to process 7% of global AI training and inferencing by 2030, and the endeavor is expected to cost about $77 billion, the FT quoted Amin as saying."
Technical,"SpaceX’s Starship successfully separated from its Super Heavy rocket booster and reached orbit Tuesday evening, but later began spinning and made an uncontrolled reentry into the Indian Ocean. SpaceX had cleared the surrounding airspace where Starship was coming down, according to the company.

The ninth test flight provided a mix of successes and failures for the company. It was the smoothest Starship test of the year, following two consecutive explosions. Starship, launched atop the Super Heavy booster, lifted off from SpaceX’s facility in southern Texas on Tuesday evening. It was also the first launch to use a flight-proven Super Heavy booster, which had launched and returned during Starship’s seventh flight test.

The heavy booster successfully separated and Starship entered space. But the ship was unable to open a side cargo hatch to deploy mock satellites in one planned test. Later in the flight, Starship lost attitude control, meaning it could no longer orient itself properly for reentry.

The ninth flight test came less than a week after the Federal Aviation Administrationcleared SpaceXto perform the test flight of its Starship rocket system following those back-to-back explosions earlier this year.

In January,SpaceXcaught theStarship’s heavy booster rocketon its descent for a second time. Starship successfully separated from the booster and ignited its rockets to ascend to orbit, but it was soon lost after suffering an anomaly. Debris from Starship fell into the airspace near Puerto Rico, prompting the FAA to reroute several aircraft in the airspace.

SpaceX conducted another test in March. The Super Heavy booster successfully separated and wascaughtby the launch tower in Texas for a third time. Starship reached space, but eight minutes into the flight, the ship lost multiple Raptor engines and began to spiral.

As a result of the two explosions, the FAA expanded the size of hazard areas in the U.S. and other countries for the flight based on an updated safety analysis provided by SpaceX. After completing an investigation in the loss of Starship on its eighth flight test, SpaceX made several hardware changes to increase reliability."
Technical,"Anthropic has begun to roll out a “voice mode” for its Claude chatbot apps.

The voice mode (in beta for now) allows Claude mobile app users to have “complete spoken conversations with Claude,” and will arrive in English over the next few weeks, according to Anthropic’sofficial account on Xandupdated documentationon the company’s website.

At leastone user on Xreports having gained access to voice mode late Tuesday. By default, it’s powered by Anthropic’sClaude Sonnet 4model.

“Voice mode … enables you to speak to Claude and hear responses through voice, making it easier to use Claude when your hands are busy but your mind isn’t,” reads asupport page. “Voice mode transforms how you interact with Claude by … displaying key points on-screen as Claude speaks [and] allowing you to speak to Claude and hear Claude’s voice responses.”

A number of AI companies, including OpenAI, offer voice chat experiences for their respective chatbots. Google, for example, hasGemini Live, while xAI has Voice Mode for Grok. Each lets users interact with bots by speaking instead of typing, making conversations feel more natural and intuitive.

With Anthropic’s flavor of voice mode, users can chat about things like documents and images, and choose from five distinct voice options. Users can also switch between text and voice on the fly, and see a transcript and summary following conversations.

The capability has certain limits. Voice conversations count toward regular usage caps — Anthropic says that 20-30 conversations is what most free users can expect. Moreover, only paid Claude subscribers can take advantage of a Google Workspace connector that allows voice mode to access Google Calendar appointments and Gmail emails (Google Docs integration is exclusive to Claude Enterprise plans).

Anthropic CPO Mike Kriegerconfirmedthe company was working on voice capabilities for Claude in an interview with the Financial Times in early March. According to the report, Anthropic was holding talks with Amazon, the company’s major investor and partner, and voice-focused AI startup ElevenLabs, to possibly drive future voice features for Claude.

It’s unclear which of those partnerships, if any, came to fruition."
Technical,"OpenAI is exploring ways for users to sign in to third-party apps using their ChatGPT account, the company noted on aweb pagepublished Tuesday. OpenAI is currently gauging interest from developers who might want to integrate this service into their apps.

ChatGPT is quickly becoming one of the largest consumer applications in the world, now with roughly600 million monthly active users. To capitalize on this popularity, OpenAI seems eager to try and expand into other consumer areas, such asonline shopping,social media, andpersonal devices.A potential “Sign in with ChatGPT” feature could help OpenAI compete with other massive consumer technology companies — such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft — that help people with a wide range of online services, including a quick way to sign in to third-party apps.

Earlier this month, OpenAI launched apreview of the “Sign in with ChatGPT”experience for developers in Codex CLI, the company’s open source AI coding tool for terminals. The feature let developers connect their ChatGPT Free, Plus, or Pro accounts to their API accounts. OpenAI offered Plus users $5 in API credits to sign in with ChatGPT, and Pro users $50 in API credits.

OpenAI seems to be interested in integrating the sign-in service with a broad array of companies. The developer interest form asks for companies to specify their app’s user base, ranging from tiny companies with fewer than 1,000 weekly users to massive apps with over 100 million weekly users. The form also asks developers how they charge for AI features today and whether they’re customers of the OpenAI API.

CEO Sam Altmannoted in 2023that the company may look into a “sign in with OpenAI” feature in 2024. However, it now appears OpenAI is more seriously building out the capability today, in 2025. It’s unclear when the sign-in feature would go live for users of ChatGPT or how many companies have signed up to be part of it.

OpenAI did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment."
Technical,"In May 2025, Mozilla announced that it wasshutting down the popular read-it-later app Pocket, which it had acquiredback in 2017 for an undisclosed amount.

While Pocket helped users save and discover millions of articles, Mozilla said the way people are browsing the web is changing, and it plans to focus its resources on other projects.

Pocket users have until October 8, 2025, to export their saved articles and other items, including lists, archives, favorites, notes, and highlights. This essentially means you will have to find a new home to build a reading list through another save-it-later app.

To help users with this transition, we’ve rounded up a number of apps you might want to consider.

Matteris aGoogle Ventures-backed companythat makes an eponymous iOS app along with browser extensions for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. The app lets you listen toarticles and transcribes your favorite podcasts. Though the app itself is free to use, you can pay $79.99 per year to unlock features like improved transcriptions for podcasts and YouTube videos, tools to adjust reading speed, and additional integrations with other apps like notes apps, Gmail, and Kindle.

In March 2025, the company also addedan AI-powered co-readerto answer questions about different topics users might have while reading an article.

Matter co-founder Ben Springwater says Pocket users can email him atben@getmatter.comfor a personal discount link. The company will soon offer the discount within its app and will launch a migration process for Pocket users.

Instapaper, which was founded by developer Marco Arment in 2008, is one of the oldest read-it-later apps. It’s available on both iOS and Android, and lets you save unlimited articles and videos without paying any fees. It wasacquired by Pinterest in 2016.

However, for $59.99 per year, you can add notes to saved articles, have a permanent archive of articles in your accounts, create a text-to-speech playlist to listen to stories, enable full text search for all saved items, and get the ability to send articles to your Kindle.

The company saysPocket users can import their account into Instapaperat instapaper.com/user. Users who import this way will also receive an email offering a three-month free trial to Instapaper Premium.

Raindropworks primarily as an alternative bookmark manager for web browsers. However, its accompanying mobile apps for iOS and Android allow you to read your saved articles or PDFs at any time. The free version gives you unlimited bookmark saving along with integrations like Zapier and IFTTT.

If you decide to pay $33 per year, you will get AI-powered suggestions for organizing your content better, full text-search, reminders for your bookmarks, a duplicate and broken links finder, and a file upload limit of 10GB per month.

Former Twitter engineer Joe Fabisevichcreated Plinky to allow users to save and categorize any kind of link, including articles, videos, recipes, and memes. The app is available across all Apple platforms, along with browser extensions to save links. Once you’re signed up,Plinkylets you use folders and tags to categorize your links, and even set reminders to read them at a specific time.

You can save 50 links, create three folders, and use five tags with the free version. To remove these restrictions, you can pay $3.99 per month, $39.99 a year, or a one-time fee of $159.99. Pro users are able to save unlimited links, create an unlimited number of folders, use an unlimited number of tags, and set an unlimited number of reminders.

With Pocket’s shutdown on the horizon,Fabisevich saysa dedicated Reader Mode will soon be added to Plinky’s app. The app is also offering a 50% discount on the Pro tier through the end of May 2025.

Paperspanis a very simple app that offers a reading list across devices; allows you to add notes; and has text-to-speech functionality. The app is free, but it offers an $8.99 per month subscription to unlock advanced search, as well as the ability to create playlists, show reading stats, and send your articles to Kindle. Though the app works, PaperSpan hasn’t been updated for some time, which may not be a good signal about its long-term future. The app is available on both iOS and Android.

Readwise, a tool to add notes and highlights to articles, launched itsReader app in 2021. The app allows you to import RSS feeds, YouTube videos, Twitter threads, and more to read at your convenience. Because of its integration with Readwise, the Reader app offers great annotation features. It also features offline text search and an AI assistant.

Plus, you can integrate Reader with knowledge management apps such as Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, Evernote, and Logseq. The app is free to try for 30 days, and then you have to pay a $9.99 per month Readwise subscription to access it.

Readwise is letting Pocket users save their entire Pocket archive into Readerand notes that its app supportsa number of features — like PDFs, ePubs, X posts, AI, and filtering — which Pocket never did.

DoubleMemoryis a new indie app focused on the Apple ecosystem, and it has native apps for both Mac and iOS. On Mac, you can easily save any link or content by pressingCmd + Ctwice. The saved content will then appear in a Pinterest-style tile format.

The app also allows you to read offline and search through text, notes, and tags. You don’t need an account to start using DoubleMemory. And if you have multiple apps, it uses your iCloud account to sync content across them.

DoubleMemory is free with in-app purchases. It offers a $3.99 monthly subscription or an annual subscription of $17.99.

Recallworks as a browser extension and a mobile app that allows users to save content from the web, including articles, PDFs, blog posts, podcasts, Wikipedia pages, YouTube videos, and recipes. However, unlike traditional read-it-later apps, Recall uses AI to automatically summarize content, categorize it, and then resurface it when it’s related to something new you’re looking to learn about.

Designed to enhance your ability to remember information, you can review your summaries from your personal knowledge base on a saved spaced repetition schedule.

Recall is free to try with support for up to 10 free, AI-generated summaries. After that, you can continue to use Recall as a read-it-later tool, or you canupgradeto a $7 per month plan for unlimited AI summaries and other features.

Wallabagis an open source read-it-later app that’s also available as an €11 per year hosted subscription, if you prefer. The app itself works across browsers and mobile devices, offers a reader mode for more comfortable reading, and supports importing data from other services like Pocket, Instapaper, and others.

Open source web appReadeckis designed to help you organize any web content you want to revisit later, whether that’s articles, videos, photos, or anything else. You can also use the service to highlight text, export articles to e-book format, save video transcripts, and more.

Readeck works as a browser extension so you can save your bookmarks as you surf the web. Users can host Readeck themselves, but the company says it will offer a hosted version in 2025. It’s also developing a mobile app.

Obsidian‘sweb clipping servicelets you highlight and capture web pages you want to save with just a click on its browser extension. You can also use templates that customize how certain types of web pages are saved. For instance, articles are saved with their citations and footnotes, while recipes will include ingredients, steps, and nutrition. You can even set up custom templates to save from your favorite websites.

As an open source app, Web Clipper is free to use, allowing you to highlight text, images, and blocks of content for saving into theObsidiannote-taking app.

Karakeep‘s bookmarking app lets you save links, notes, and images, and then uses AI to automatically tag items and make retrieving them faster. The app includes other features like support for lists, bulk actions, dark mode, full-text search, and more.

Theopen source appis available on iOS and Android as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. You can support its developerhere.

Deweyis another “save everything”-style app that lets you save and organize web links, videos, and images, including posts from social media sites like X, TikTok, Bluesky, Threads, Reddit, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others.

The service offers built-in organizational tools like folders and tags, AI bulk tagging, keyboard shortcuts, automatic syncing to Notion, export, a personalized RSS feed, and more. Dewey offers multipleplans, starting at $7.50 per month, which you can choose to pay annually for $30 off.

Technical,"Gov. Abbott of Texas officially signed into law the online child safety bill that will require Apple and Google’s app stores to verify the age of their users and obtain approval from parents before minors download or make in-app purchases. The law will go into effect on January 1.

The bill made headlines last weekas it was revealedApple CEO Tim Cook reportedly called Gov. Abbott in hopes of convincing him to either ditch or make changes to the law after it passed the Texas legislature. Apple, alongside Google, was working with interest groups to fight the legislation, with Apple in particular saying that the implementation of such a bill could pose a threat to user privacy.

Apple lobbyists managed to stop a similar bill from passing in Louisiana last year, though the state is revisiting the bill.

Technical,"Most delivery automation stops at the curb. But forVehoand Zurich-based robotics startup Rivr, the real challenge — and opportunity — lies in those final 100 yards from van to doorstep.

In a pilot program launching Tuesday in Austin, Rivr’s four-wheeled, stair-climbing delivery robot, which CEO and founder Marko Bjelonic describes as “a dog on roller skates,” will ferry packages from Veho’s vans directly to customers’ front doors.

The companies are starting small, they told TechCrunch exclusively. Just one highly supervised robot will work daily, making five- to six-hour runs over the span of a couple weeks throughout Austin. But both companies see it as a critical step toward solving a unique slice of the end-to-end autonomous delivery journey.

Bjelonic says in last-mile delivery, “robotics makes an impact by actually solving these very challenging problems that are actually quite easy for humans but hard for robots. And we see [Rivr] as a differentiator, almost as the next evolutionary step from the sidewalk robots.”

The partnership with Veho also gives Rivr an opportunity to both test its technology and accumulate data necessary to build a general physical AI framework.

“What we have seen in the robotic space is that there’s a data barrier, because ChatGPT and other chatbots have the internet as training data, and autonomous cars have thousands of cars on the street that they can attach sensors to and start collecting data,” Bjelonic told TechCrunch. “But in the robotics world, that kind of dataset is missing, so you need to find the meaningful use case where you can solve a real problem, and then you can start collecting all of the data to make these robots more intelligent.”

For Veho, which delivers across 50 U.S. markets for brands like Sephora, Saks, HelloFresh, and more, this partnership is a chance to test what automation looks like from the van to the customer’s door. That could eventually allow for more deliveries to take place at once, particularly in dense urban areas where both the driver and the robot can tag-team a particular street simultaneously. Bjelonic says Rivr’s “robot helpers” can also “reduce the workload on these drivers” by taking over the physically demanding task of walking door to door.

During the Austin trial, a Rivr employee will accompany the bot to ensure safety and delivery quality. Bjelonic told TechCrunch the bots can operate autonomously, but remote operators will be able to tap in if they get stuck.

The Austin pilot will start in the more residential area of Northwest Austin before expanding to denser areas of town, according to Fred Cook, Veho’s co-founder and CTO. In the future, Cook says he could imagine pairing the vehicles with certain types of vehicles with charging stations for the bots to keep them going for a full day of work.

Rivr hopes to use the learnings from its partnership with Veho to scale to 100 bots by next year and thousands in 2027. The startup is currently operating in the U.K. through a partnership with delivery platform Evri. Rivr has raised more than $25 million, including from a Jeff Bezos-led round thatvalued the company at $100 million."
Technical,"Meta isdividing its AI department into two new teams, according to a report from Axios. Now the company’s AI personnel will be assigned to an AI products team, or an AGI Foundations unit. No jobs appear to have been cut.

The AI products team will focus on consumer-facing efforts like the AI features within Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well as Meta’s newstand-alone AI app.

The AGI Foundations unit will focus on more of the bigger picture efforts, like improving its Llama models.

As companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic make moves, Meta is trying its best to stay neck-and-neck with the competition. The company recently launched aLlama for Startupsprogram to encourage early-stage companies to use their products for generative AI applications. Meanwhile, much of Meta’sLlamaConevent in April was geared toward showing that it can compete with OpenAI."
Technical,"If and when AI will start replacing human labor has been the subject of numerous debates.

While it’s still hard to say with certainty if AI is beginning to take over roles previously done by humans, a recent survey from theWorld Economic Forumfound that 40% of employers intend to cut staff where AI can automate tasks.

Researchers at SignalFire, adata-driven VC firmthat tracks job movements of over 600 million employees and 80 million companies on LinkedIn, believe they may be seeing first signs of AI’s impact on hiring.

When analyzing hiring trends, SignalFire noticed that tech companies recruited fewer recent college graduates in 2024 than they did in 2023. Meanwhile, tech companies, especially the top 15 Big Tech businesses, ramped up their hiring of experienced professionals.

Specifically, SignalFirefoundthat Big Tech companies reduced the hiring of new graduates by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Meanwhile, graduate recruitment at startups decreased by 11% compared to the prior year. Although SignalFire wouldn’t reveal exactly how many fewer grads were hired according to their data, a spokesperson told us it was thousands.

While adoption of new AI tools might not fully explain the dip in recent grad hiring, Asher Bantock, SignalFire’s head of research, says there’s “convincing evidence” that AI is a significant contributing factor.

Entry-level jobs are susceptible to automation because they often involve routine, low-risk tasks that generative AI handles well.

AI’s newcoding, debugging,financial research, andsoftware installationabilities could mean companies need fewer people to do that type of work. AI’s ability to handle certain entry-level tasks means some jobs for new graduates could soon be obsolete.

Gabe Stengel, the founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, started his career at Lazard investment bank where he helped large pharma companies buy biotech startups. Rogo’s tool “can do almost all the work I did in the analysis of those companies,” Stengel said onstage at Newcomer’s financial technology summit last week. “We can put together the materials, diligence the company, look through their financials.”

While most large investment banks haven’t explicitly reduced analyst hiring due to AI yet, executives at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley previously considered cutting junior staff hires by up to two-thirds and lowering the pay of those they hire because the work with AI is not as demanding as before, theNew York Timesreported last year.

Although AI’s threat to low-skilled jobs is real, tech companies’ need for experienced professionals is still rising. According to SignalFire’s report, Big Tech companies increased hiring by 27% for professionals with two to five years of experience, while startups hired 14% more individuals in that same seniority range.

A frustrating paradox emerges for recent graduates: They can’t get hired without experience, but they can’t get experience without being hired. While this dilemma is not new, Heather Doshay, SignalFire’s people and talent partner, says it is considerably exacerbated by AI.

Dashay’s advice to new grads: master AI tools. “AI won’t take your job if you’re the one who’s best at using it,” she said."
Technical,"WordPressannouncedon Tuesday that it has formed an AI team to steward the development of AI products among its developer community.

Technical,"Self-driving truck startup TuSimple (now CreateAI) sent a trove of sensitive data — effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system — to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement, according toThe Wall Street Journal.

The transfers to Chinese truck manufacturer Foton happened around February2022, just a week after TuSimple signed the agreement in which U.S. regulators ordered the company to separate its business and technology from China-based employees and partners with firewalls and governance controls. The data sharing continued up until TuSimple’s deadline to comply with the agreement six months later, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence that the Journal viewed.

A subsequent investigation with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) found the data sharing didn’t technically violate the agreement, though TuSimple was fined for other infractions and paid a $6 million settlement without admitting fault, per the Journal.

TechCrunch was unable to reach TuSimple, now CreateAI, for comment.

Still, the saga of TuSimple’s data transfers to China exposes the limits of U.S. safeguards meant to balance foreign investment with national security. And it’s not just data that TuSimple has been trying to get across the border.

This latest revelation comes eight months afterTechCrunch reportedthat some of TuSimple’s shareholders were trying to block the company from transferring its U.S. funds — roughly $450 million at the time — to the company’s Chinese subsidiary to fund a pivot to AI animation and content generation. That drama is still unfolding as one of TuSimple’s co-founders, Xiaodi Hou, fights in court for control over his voting shares so he canpush for liquidationof the company. In December 2024,TuSimple officially rebranded to CreateAI.

The company has been embroiled in controversy since going public via IPO in 2021. TuSimple started as a China-backed startup founded in 2015 by Hou and Lu Chen, an entrepreneur with ties to Sina Corp. It quickly became an autonomous vehicle industry favorite, managing to raise around $2 billion from a mixture of Chinese and U.S.-based heavy hitters, and was one of the first in the U.S. to successfully complete a fully driverless run on public highways.

TuSimple’s plans took a turn for the worse amid internal struggles and federal investigations into the company’s ties with China, leading to its decision toexit U.S. operationsand voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January 2024. The goal was to restart self-driving operations in China, but both the CFIUS agreement and other court orders that barred the company from transferring assets — financial or otherwise — to China made it next to impossible to restart operations there, the company has told TechCrunch.

The Journal’s reporting sheds light on a previouslyreported controversy regarding Hydron, a Chinese hydrogen trucking startup founded by Chen, which shared an office with TuSimple China. The overlap between Hydron and TuSimple was the subject of the 2022 CFIUS probe, during which TuSimple revealed that its employees spent paid hours working for Hydron in 2021 and shared confidential information with the company.

According to documents the Journal viewed, TuSimple negotiated a deal in 2021 between Hydron and Foton to develop autonomous trucks. Foton, a subsidiary of state-owned BAIC Group, has an agreement with a Chinese military university to work on AV tech.

Through a combination of emails, Slack messages, and video calls, TuSimple sent partners technical instructions for server dimensions, brake designs, sensors, steering, power supply, and chips, per the Journal. Employees also routinely downloaded autonomy source code developed by their American counterparts.

As geopolitical tensions and competition with China rise, TuSimple’s ties are serving as a cautionary tale for Washington that has helped drive ashift in U.S. policy, prompting stricter rules on Chinese-linked tech deals and fueling a broader push to block high-risk transactions outright."
Technical,"Salesforce has acquired cloud data management firm Informatica in an $8 billion equity deal, marking a major move in its push to strengthen its AI and data infrastructure capabilities.

The announcement, made Tuesday, comes about a year after early rumors of the acquisition sent both companies’ stock pricessliding. At the time, Informaticadeniedit was for sale, but a lot can change in a year.

Under the terms of the deal, Salesforce will pay $25 in cash per share for Informatica’s Class A and Class B-1 common stock, adjusting for its prior investment in the company.

Informatica was founded in 1993 and works with more than 5,000 customers across more than 100 countries. Thecompany had a $7.1 billionmarket cap at the time of publication.

This acquisition will help bolster Salesforce’s agentic AI ambitions, the company’s press release stated, by giving the company more data infrastructure and governance to help its AI agents run more “safely, responsibly, and at scale across the modern enterprise.”

“Together, we’ll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360, enabling autonomous agents to act with intelligence, context, and confidence across every enterprise,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in the press release. “This is a transformational step in delivering enterprise-grade AI that is safe, responsible, and deeply integrated with the world’s data.”

The path to this deal began in April 2024, when reports surfaced that Salesforce was eyeing Informatica. The market reaction was swift — both companies’ shares dipped on fears of a difficult integration or strategic mismatch. Informatica later issued a public statement denying any sale discussions. But what once seemed unlikely is now official.

Informatica isn’t the first data management company Salesforce has acquired in the past year. In September, Salesforcesnapped up Own Company for $1.9 billion in cash.

“Data security has never been more critical, and Own’s proven expertise and products will enhance our ability to offer robust data protection and management solutions to our customers,” Salesforce general manager Steve Fisher said in a press release at the time.

Technical,"Tesla sales in Europe and the U.K. have fallen by nearly half, according to data released Tuesday by theEuropean Automobile Manufacturers Association. In April, Tesla sold 7,261 vehicles in the European Union, European Free Trade Association, and U.K., a 49% year-over-year decline.

The fall in sales is particularly alarming considering Tesla recently launched a new Model Y vehicle, the kind of release that would typically attract more consumers. A closer look at car sales in the region shows that Tesla competitors have not experienced the same decline, suggesting that CEO Elon Musk’s political activities and alignment with U.S. President Donald Trump have had anoutsized effect on the brand.

Tesla sales have struggled for months globally. Tesla recorded336,681 deliveries, its worst quarterly performance in more than two years. That dip in sales came as Muskled DOGE, the“advisory body”that laid off thousands of federal employees and attempted to eliminate entire agencies and programs. His involvement in the government has proven sounpopularthat Musk publicly stated he would refocus his efforts back on Tesla.

In April, new car registrations in the EU, U.K., and EFTA countries like Sweden and Norway fell 0.3 percent to 1,077,186 units year-over-year, with the gas and diesel vehicles seeing the largest declines.

EV sales still make up a smaller share of the overall market but continue to see growth. EV sales grew 27.8% to 184,685 vehicles in April compared to the same month in 2024. Hybrids, meanwhile, had the biggest jump with a 31% uptick in sales.

Meanwhile, figuresreleased last weekfrom market research firm Jato Dynamics shows Chinese manufacturers like BYD gaining ground despite tariffs by the EU. Registrations of EVs made by Chinese automakers in April rose by 59% year on year, reaching almost 15,300 units, according to Jato Dynamics."

By analyzing public RNA-seq data through a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline, scientists working with the Sbarro Health Research Organization (SHRO) have developed an in-depth view of the molecular mechanisms involved in asbestos-induced carcinogenesis. The findings highlight both known and novel genes and pathways, providing valuable insights into the biological processes disrupted in exposed patients. This work contributes to ongoing efforts to define reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and lays the groundwork for future investigations and potential clinical applications in personalized approaches to MPM management.

The article, titled ""From Asbestos Exposure to Carcinogenesis: Transcriptomic Signatures in Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,"" describes a new study investigating differential gene expression in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) associated with documented asbestos exposure, with the aim of identifying specific transcriptomic biomarkers that could support advances in precision medicine.

Published inExperimental and Molecular Pathology, the paper was a collaborative effort between teams led by Professor Antonio Giordano, M.D., Ph.D., Founder and Director of the SHRO and Professor at Temple University, and Professor Elisa Frullanti, Ph.D., Director of the Cancer Genomics & Systems Biology Lab and Professor of Genetics at the University of Siena. The study was conducted within the Med Biotech Hub and Competence Center at the University of Siena, in collaboration with the SHRO and the Sbarro Institute for Molecular Medicine and Cancer Research at Temple University. Funding was provided by the Italian National Institute for Insurance against Accidents at Work (INAIL) through the BRiC-INAIL 2022 program. Co-authors include Diletta Rosati, Bianca Giulia Maurizi, Viola Bianca Serio, Debora Maffeo, Angela Rina, Francesca Mari, and Maria Palmieri.

Using publicly available RNA sequencing datasets, the research team employed a comprehensive bioinformatics pipeline to perform differential gene expression and functional enrichment analyses. The results identified a distinct set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in MPM patients with documented asbestos exposure. Many of these genes are involved in key biological processes such as ion homeostasis, oxidative stress response, and cellular component disorganization-hallmarks of asbestos-induced cellular damage that may play a role in tumor initiation and progression.

The findings shed new light on the molecular mechanisms of MPM and offer a foundation for future research into predictive and prognostic biomarkers. By pinpointing specific transcriptomic changes, the study contributes to efforts in precision medicine and supports the development of improved diagnostic tools and potential therapeutic targets for this deadly disease.

""This type of precision medicine means that we are one step closer to identifying patients more likely to develop Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma,"" says Giordano, ""and we are closer to developing potential treatments.""

As the global incidence of mesothelioma continues to rise-due in part to the long latency period of asbestos exposure and ongoing environmental risks-this study represents a critical step toward more personalized and effective management strategies for patients."
Medicine,"A new device that monitors the waste-removal system of the brain may help to prevent Alzheimer's and other neurological diseases, according to a study published today in Nature Biomedical Engineering.

In the study, participants were asleep when they wore the device: a head cap embedded with electrodes that measures shifts in fluid within brain tissue, the neural activity from sleep to wakefulness and changes in the brain's blood vessels.

By measuring these three features, the researchers found they could monitor the brain's glymphatic system, which acts as a waste-removal and nutrient-delivery system.

This is the first time that researchers have been able to track the flow of glymphatic fluid in individuals at different levels of sleep through a single night. Previously these processes could only be monitored at university research centers by using MRI, an approach that is too slow to track minute changes in individuals' sleep stages.

These assumptions, Iliff added, were based on rodent studies he and others conducted over the last decade. When the research involved human participants, however, the investigators were surprised at the findings.

They found that the glymphatic system was active in both deep and REM sleep, as well as when the person was waking up. Rather than turning on and off, switchlike, this clearance function appeared to accelerate the longer a person slept, and then slow down gradually as they woke, Iliff noted.

""It lets us monitor how this system is related to sleep and how it's affected by sleep disruption in humans - something that is critical if we are trying to understand the role that this biology plays in clinical psychiatric and neurological conditions,"" Iliff said.

These findings are important because the glymphatic system plays a vital role in clearing brain proteins whose abnormal accumulation is linked to disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, he said.

""This is a critical step in the development of therapeutics targeting glymphatic function,"" Iliff said. ""And if you can develop therapeutics that improve glymphatic function, you might be able to treat or prevent conditions like Alzheimer's disease.""

The wearable device, developed by California-based Applied Cognition, could have several potential uses, Iliff suggested. It could help scientists define whether glymphatic dysfunction contributes to the development conditions such as Alzheimer's, traumatic brain injury and migraine headaches. It could inform the development of new therapeutics to improve glymphatic function. And it could be used to identify patients at risk for these conditions, who might benefit most from these new therapeutics.

This study was conducted with participants at the University of Washington Medical Center – Montlake and the University of Florida between October 2022 and June 2023. In all 35 participants participated in benchmarking study in Florida, and an additional 14 in replication study in Seattle. All participants ranged between 56 and 66 years of age.

Swati Rane Levendovszky an MRI physicist and former director of UW Medicine's  Diagnostic Imaging Sciences Center, also worked on the project. She now works at the University of Kansas Medical Center.

""This work is pivotal in defining the role glymphatic dysfunction plays in Alzheimer's and discovering therapies to rescue it,"" said Dr. Paul Dagum, CEO of Applied Cognition. ""Our platform has already identified a promising drug candidate that improves glymphatic clearance in early clinical trials.""

Iliff's lab studies the glymphatic system and its role in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injury.

This study was funded by Applied Cognition, where Iliff served as chair of the company's scientific advisory board and received compensation in that role."
Medicine,"Macrophages and other immune cells are the natural frontline immune warriors of our body, defending the body against invading pathogens and cancer cells. Yet despite their innate ""combat"" capabilities, precisely directing and activating these cells in vivo has remained challenging. In recent years, the emergence of bio-microrobots has shown great potential to convert these ""natural soldiers"" into controllable function units using external physical fields and biomimetic design. However, existing approaches typically rely on magnetic, acoustic or optical fields to drive cell movement, but hard to tuning their biological functions. Besides, these methods require exogenous material or genetic modification, raising serious biosafety and immune-rejection concerns.In a new paper published inLight: Science & Applications, a team of scientists led by Professor Hongbao Xin from Jinan University, China, has developed a light-powered phagocytic macrophage microrobot (""Phagobot"") that combines innate immune functions with robotic controllability. The phagobot can be ""woken up"" and navigated simply using a tightly focused near-infrared (NIR) light beam.""We wanted to find a way to control immune cells with the same precision as machines, but without taking away their natural strengths,"" said Professor Xin, the study's corresponding author. ""With this dual-mode optical control strategy, macrophages remain completely natural, yet they can be precisely instructed to move, seek, and phagocytosis of bio-threats both in vitro and in vivo.""The process begins with a tightly focused NIR laser beam (1064 nm) focusing on the surface of resting macrophages. Within a few minutes, the localized photothermal effect triggers temperature-sensitive ion channels in the cell membrane, causing calcium to rush into the cell. This chain reaction activates the cell's energy metabolism and leads to a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is a hallmark of macrophage activation. As a result, the macrophage transforms, extending flexible ""arms"" called pseudopodia, ready for action.

The extended pseudopodia in activated macrophage can act like tiny antennae to sense changes in the extracellular microenvironment. Researchers used gentle optical forces to manipulate the pseudopodia, enabling precise directional control. In this way, the phagobot could be navigated toward target locations with high spatial accuracy.""Other bio-microrobots that rely on magnetic or acoustic fields to push entire cells, which may inevitably disturb cell activity and immune state. On contrast, this method works at the subcellular level, guiding only the pseudopodia. This keeps the rest of the cell undisturbed, mimicking how immune cells naturally migrate in tissue."" Said the co-corresponding author, Associate Professor Ting Pan.In laboratory tests, the phagobot showed remarkable efficiency in targeting and engulfing a variety of bio-threats, includingStaphylococcus aureus, yeast cells, plastic nanoparticles, and tumor cell debris. The system also proved its power in vivo. Using zebrafish models, researchers labeled macrophages with fluorescent markers and successfully activated and navigated them in the complex, constantly moving gut environment. There, the phagobots located and cleared cellular debris without causing any visible tissue damage even after prolonged light exposure.""This approach overcomes the two major bottlenecks in the field of bio-microrobots: external driving systems can only drive the cells to move and the need for synthetic or genetic modifications. It provides a non-genetic platform for in vivo immune intervention, offering promising applications in targeted therapy and precision immunomodulation,"" these scientists summarized."
Medicine,"The tear film coating the eye offers a window into a person's systemic and ocular health, carrying biomarkers such as glucose, electrolytes, and proteins. Yet, existing diagnostic approaches-like tonometry or tear sampling-are often invasive, infrequent, and impractical for daily monitoring. Likewise, standard eye drop treatments suffer from poor drug retention due to blinking and drainage, limiting their therapeutic impact. Smart contact lenses have emerged as a compelling alternative. By enabling real-time sensing and controlled drug release directly on the eye, they promise to revolutionize ophthalmic care. Still, incorporating delicate microfluidic features into the curved, flexible surface of soft lenses without compromising vision or comfort remains a formidable engineering challenge. Addressing these barriers calls for continued innovation in fabrication methods and material integration.In a comprehensive review (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00909-3) published April 3, 2025, inMicrosystems & Nanoengineering, researchers from the Manipal Institute of Applied Physics and Manipal University Jaipur chart the evolution of Microfluidic contact lenses (MCLs) from concept to clinical possibility. The article examines how fabrication advances-spanning soft lithography, laser patterning, and 3D-printed mold replication-are enabling lenses to measure intraocular pressure, detect biochemical markers, and deliver medication on demand. With these capabilities, contact lenses are poised to become an all-in-one platform for diagnosis, therapy, and patient comfort.The review highlights two core applications for MCLs: sensing and treatment. For diagnostics, deformable microchannels embedded in the lens respond to pressure changes by shifting indicator fluids, enabling accurate intraocular pressure measurements-crucial for glaucoma management. Some designs have achieved sensitivities up to 708 μm/mmHg, far surpassing earlier iterations. MCLs also track tear biomarkers such as pH, glucose, lactate, and proteins via smartphone-readable colorimetric or fluorescent sensors. On the therapeutic front, drug-loaded microchambers release medication in response to external cues like magnets or electrical signals-or internal ones like pH shifts or blinking pressure. These innovations allow for on-demand delivery while maintaining the optical clarity and flexibility of the lens. Fabrication methods underpin this progress: thermoforming and PDMS replication deliver precision; 3D printing allows for personalized designs; and femtosecond lasers offer ultra-fine microchannel engraving. Though scalable production remains a challenge, these technologies are steadily converging on practical, patient-ready solutions.

The future of MCLs extends far beyond the ophthalmologist's office. In healthcare, they offer transformative potential for managing chronic eye conditions like glaucoma and dry eye syndrome, while also treating diseases such as diabetic retinopathy through localized, sustained drug delivery. Paired with mobile interfaces, they enable remote diagnostics and personalized treatment. Outside medicine, the integration of sensors, drug systems, and even display technologies hints at applications in sports, military, and wearable tech. To fully realize these possibilities, further advancements in scalable manufacturing, regulatory compliance, and long-term safety will be key. But one thing is certain: smart lenses are rapidly transitioning from laboratory prototypes to real-world tools in precision health."
Medicine,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects over 800 million people globally and is often diagnosed too late for effective intervention. Early detection depends on accurate measurement of biomarkers such as creatinine and the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (uACR). While urine testing is non-invasive and informative, standard methods are time-consuming, costly, and require specialized facilities. Existing point-of-care devices offer convenience but remain prohibitively expensive or technically complex for many users. As such, there is an urgent need for a robust, affordable, and easy-to-use platform to measure urinary creatinine with clinical precision. Due to these challenges, new approaches are needed to develop accessible diagnostic tools for CKD screening and monitoring.Researchers at the University of Manitoba, in collaboration with clinical and engineering partners, have developed a low-cost, passive microfluidic device for urine creatinine testing. Published (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00880-z) on April 2, 2025, inMicrosystems & Nanoengineering, the study details the design, fabrication, and validation of the ""uCR-Chip."" This device uses a color-based Jaffe reaction and a pressure-balanced flow system to deliver fast, stable measurements. By eliminating the need for external pumps or electricity, the uCR-Chip paves the way for affordable, decentralized kidney function testing.The uCR-Chip integrates two key innovations: a passive 2-phase pressure compensation (2-PPC) flow system and a microfluidic channel network designed for a precise 1:5 mixing ratio between urine and reagent. This setup ensures consistent chemical reactions and rapid stabilization of the colorimetric signal. Using the Jaffe reaction, which produces an orange complex when creatinine interacts with picric acid in alkaline conditions, the chip enables quantifiable optical readings via a USB microscope platform. Signal stabilization is achieved within 7 minutes, and the chip maintains detection stability for over 30 minutes-a significant improvement over conventional assays. Technical validation demonstrated a dynamic linear detection range up to 40 mM and a low detection limit of 0.521 mM, covering the full clinical range. Compared with commercial point-of-care systems, the uCR-Chip showed comparable or better accuracy and less interference from artificial urine matrices. Additionally, the optimized lenticular observation window with a flow diverter enhances signal uniformity and shortens fill time. Fabricated using dry film lithography for high precision, the device is both scalable and reproducible. Together, these features make the uCR-Chip an attractive platform for portable diagnostics.

Dr. Lin emphasized the device's affordability and scalability as key advantages for widespread public health deployment.Beyond CKD screening, the uCR-Chip offers a broader platform for real-time health monitoring in diverse scenarios, from sports medicine to maternal care and drug testing. The researchers envision integrating this chip with a similar urine albumin microfluidic device for simultaneous uACR measurement, a crucial marker for kidney damage. The design also lends itself to future upgrades using enzymatic assays or fluorescence-based detection for improved specificity. With its compact, low-cost, and electricity-free format, the uCR-Chip represents a major step toward equitable, point-of-care diagnostics tailored to both clinical and home environments."
Medicine,"America's primary care doctors are burning out, cutting back their hours, and leaving their practices early, driven in part by the demands of handling the flood of digital messages from their patients.

But a trio of new University of Michigan studies offer hope for easing this crisis, and improving both the care that patients get and the work lives of those who provide it. The studies could help primary care clinics nationwide take steps to keep the bedrock of American health care from crumbling further.

All three papers, published in theJournal of General Internal Medicine, stemmed from efforts to understand and address the concerns of primary care providers at Michigan Medicine, U-M's academic medical center.

They each center around the issue of digital messages sent by patients through their digital portals, and how clinics handle their responses within the electronic health record.

Such messages went from a trickle to a deluge five years ago with the COVID-19 pandemic, and while the flood has ebbed a bit, they now form both a key part of care and a major driver of burnout.

All the authors are from the Division of General Medicine in the Department of Internal Medicine at U-M Health, which runs multiple primary care clinics across southeast Michigan for adults and mixed populations of children and adults. The division has undertaken a major clinical practice redesign in recent years.

Women make up more than half – 57% -- of the physicians in U-M's General Medicine and Internal Medicine-Pediatrics (also called Med-Peds) clinics. That's even higher than the national average for all primary care disciplines, in which prior research has shown female physicians are especially prone to burnout and its impacts on their career decisions.

That's why Greta Branford, M.D., and her colleagues decided to look at data from a year's worth of patient portal messages handled by U-M primary care physicians, and survey data.

They found many areas where male and female physicians were similar – including the fact that both groups spent just under an hour every day handling patient messages. But they also found key areas of difference.

Women physicians were 60% more likely than their male counterparts to say that portal messages required more clinical assessment and 76% more likely to say that messages contributed to burnout. Women physicians also spent more time than male physicians on inputting orders related to patient messages per day, and writing notes documenting their clinical decisions.

Women physicians were also 60% more likely than male physicians to receive messages from patients that were negative or demeaning.

At the same time, women physicians were twice as likely as men to see the electronic health record system as easy to learn and an asset for patient education, and less likely than men to see the EHR as inhibiting quality care.

One of the key drivers of burnout related to patient messages is ""pajama time"" – that is, the time that doctors spend handling messages outside of their normal work hours, often at home late into the night or early in the morning.

That's why Jennifer Reilly Lukela, M.D. and colleagues studied an innovation that U-M General Medicine clinics launched in 2022, to try to reduce the sense of overwhelm those providers felt from handling patient messages and other in-basket tasks.

The clinics gave physicians a 20-minute slot for every half day they saw patients, which they could use to handle patient questions, refill requests, test results or new symptoms for which a patient was requesting advice via a portal message.

Lukela and colleagues looked at how these slots, which the authors now refer to as Patient Asynchronous Care Effort or PACE slots, impacted clinical care delivery, billing, physician pajama time, and physician experiences, through surveys of more than 100 providers and analysis of activity in the EHR.

In all, they found that the addition of these slots didn't diminish the total number of hours of ""pajama time"" physicians spent handling digital clinical duties outside their official hours. Nor did the clinics see a significant drop in patient visits, time spent with patients, or billable time measured in relative value units or RVUs.

What did change, Lukela says, is how physicians felt about their workload. Nearly all felt it helped them address urgent incoming messages in a timelier manner and to feel less overwhelmed by their inbaskets. Many commented that they were now less worried about missing an urgent issue or safety risk. And most (88%) perceived that the slots decreased their pajama time – when in fact overall there wasn't a measured drop.

""As we think about physician wellbeing and the sustainability of careers in primary care, one of the most critical things is agency over your day and control over your schedule,"" said Lukela. ""With the PACE innovation, we are both trying to meet patients where they're at and make primary care a sustainable practice for physicians by recognizing all the kinds of work they do, without reducing financial sustainability.""

Lukela serves as vice chair for clinical strategy and community engagement of the U-M Division of General Medicine. She notes that Michigan Medicine's Department of Family Medicine, as well as several other academic primary care groups across the nation, have also recently begun giving providers time to handle portal message-related demands.

""Asynchronous care is here to stay,"" she said. ""We need to figure out how to deliver this form of care efficiently and build it into the system, to prevent provider burnout, and ensure patient safety.""

Another recent paper by U-M General Medicine researchers shows the impact of an innovation that leverages the skills of the entire clinic team to make sure patient messages get handled appropriately. The new paper gives the results from a test conducted in one clinic, and compared with two others, before rolling it out broadly.

Led by Nicole Hadeed, M.D., the team interviewed all types of clinicians including medical assistants, patient service associates, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, and physicians. They used this to develop standards and a routing guide for different kinds of patient portal messages, including communication among members of the clinic as they worked to handle a patient's message.

To look at what happened in the intervention clinic and compare it to the two other clinics, Hadeed and colleagues examined 343,000 messages related to 31,500 patients, including messages from patients and among staff.

This team-based approach aimed to spread the load across different types of clinicians, reduce redundant routing and unnecessary ""FYI"" messages, and ensure that patients reporting new symptoms receive a phone call to triage their issue.

At the clinic where they implemented the guides, there was a 16% reduction in messages per physician, and a 62% reduction in duplicate messages sent to multiple clinicians, compared with two other clinics that hadn't implemented the changes. There was also a 26% reduction in the messages sent directly to physicians at the intervention site, larger than the reduction at the control sites.

""While many clinician and staff reactions to the patient portal emphasize drowning under the brunt of clinical care happening over in-basket messages, it was evident that a significant proportion of messages are created by inefficient routing practices within the clinic itself, driven by a lack of transparency of each person's role within the multidisciplinary team,"" Hadeed said.

Through the evidence-driven guides, ""we were able to significantly reduce the volume of messages by simply outlining roles and routing guidance for common issues,"" she continued. ""Focusing on getting the right message to the right place the first time was a simple and powerful intervention to reduce intra-clinic message traffic that is budget-neutral and completely within the clinic site's control.""

Medicine,"Four leading organizations in lifestyle medicine, obesity medicine, and nutrition-the American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM), the American Society for Nutrition (ASN), the Obesity Medicine Association (OMA), and The Obesity Society (TOS)-have jointly released a clinical advisory titled ""Nutritional Priorities to Support GLP-1 Therapy for Obesity."" Published across four peer-reviewed journals, this consensus-based guidance reflects an interdisciplinary collaboration to help clinicians support patients receiving GLP-1 receptor agonists for obesity care with evidence-based nutritional and behavioral strategies.

GLP-1 therapies, including both single and combination agents, have emerged as powerful tools in the management of obesity, demonstrating average placebo-adjusted weight reductions of 5–18% in clinical trials, along with improvements in metabolic, functional and cardiovascular outcomes. However, sustaining these benefits over time and maximizing patient outcomes require comprehensive care that integrates lifestyle intervention-particularly nutrition therapy-into the treatment plan.

""GLP-1s represent an important advancement in obesity care,"" said lead author and advisory chair Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH, of Tufts University. ""But these medications can present challenges, including gastrointestinal side effects, risk of micronutrient deficiencies, muscle and bone loss, poor long-term adherence with subsequent weight regain, and high costs; and, on their own, are not enough. Nutrition therapy and lifestyle support are essential components to address these challenges, help patients maximize and maintain health gains over time, and ensure we are using these drugs wisely, effectively, and without bankrupting the healthcare system.""

The advisory outlines eight key nutritional priorities to support patients on GLP-1 medications, emphasizing the importance of (1) patient-centered initiation of therapy, (2) careful baseline nutritional assessment, (3) management of gastrointestinal side effects, (4) personalized, nutrient-dense, minimally processed diets, (5) prevention of micronutrient deficiencies (6) adequate protein intake and strength training to preserve lean mass, (7) leveraging a good diet to maximize weight reduction, and (8) promoting other lifestyle changes around activity, sleep, mental stress, substance use, and social connections to maximize long-term success.

Recent evidence supports this integrative model. In studies evaluating combined pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions, patients receiving both GLP-1 therapy and structured nutrition guidance achieved greater weight loss, better adherence, and were more likely to sustain weight loss after discontinuing medication compared to those receiving pharmacotherapy alone (Wadden et al., 2021; Kushner et al., 2022).

Despite the known benefits, most individuals prescribed GLP-1s do not currently receive adequate nutritional counseling or behavioral support. This advisory seeks to fill that gap with practical, interdisciplinary guidance for implementation in clinical practice.

While certain considerations-such as GI tolerance and micronutrient balance-are important for clinicians to address, the advisory emphasizes that a proactive lifestyle-based approach can mitigate risks and optimize outcomes. With obesity prevalence continuing to rise worldwide, the integration of nutrition therapy into GLP-1-based care offers a scalable strategy to extend the clinical and economic value of these therapies.

Clinicians are encouraged to use the advisory's tools and frameworks to help patients translate nutrition guidance into sustainable behaviors, making lifestyle medicine an active ingredient in every ""prescription"" for obesity care.

The joint advisory is simultaneously published in theAmerican Journal of Lifestyle Medicine(ACLM),The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition(ASN),Obesity Pillars®(OMA) andObesity(TOS).Leading researchers will discuss the advisory and its implications during two sessions at NUTRITION 2025, the flagship annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition to be held May 31–June 3 in Orlando, Florida:

Medicine,"The number of people living with a history of cancer in the United States is estimated at 18.6 million as of January 1, 2025 and projected to exceed 22 million by 2035, according to a new report,Cancer Treatment and Survivorship Statistics, 2025,led by the American Cancer Society (ACS). The study also found notable disparities in treatment for many common cancers, including lung and colorectal. The findings are published today inCA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians,alongside its consumer-friendly companion,Fast Facts: Cancer Treatment and Survivorship, available on cancer.org.

For the study, ACS and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) collaborated to estimate cancer prevalence in the U.S. using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registries, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries and National Center for Health Statistics, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the U.S. Census Bureau. In addition, cancer treatment patterns were presented from the National Cancer Database along with a brief overview of treatment‐related side effects.

Highlights of the study include:

""Efforts to expand access to high‐quality care regardless of your skin color or bank balance are vital to reducing disparities and advancing equity for everyone affected by cancer, which is ultimately all of us,"" said Rebecca Siegel, senior scientific director, cancer risk factors & screening surveillance research at the American Cancer Society and senior author of the study. ""We need to do more to level the playing field and end barriers to quality care both during and after treatment.""

""These findings demonstrate that early detection and improved treatment are making a real difference in the fight against cancer,"" saidLisa A. Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (ACS CAN), the advocacy affiliate of the American Cancer Society. ""There continues to be an urgent need to protect and expand access to care, especially at a time when proposed cuts to Medicaid and prevention and screening programs threaten to reverse our progress and undo the gains we have achieved. We cannot afford to turn back the clock now. ACS CAN will continue to work with lawmakers to stress that cuts have consequences and will only slow our work to end cancer as we know it, for everyone.""Other ACS researchers contributing to the study include Dr. Leticia Nogueira, Dr. Robin Yabroff, Dr. Farhad Islami, Dr. Rick Alteri, and Dr. Ahmedin Jemal."
Medicine,"A new type of immunotherapy that targets aggressive blood cancers shows promising results alongside manageable side effects, according to the results of an international phase 1/2 clinical trial led by researchers at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

The clinical trial evaluated the safety andefficacy ofan innovative CAR-T cellimmunotherapythat is specifically designed to attack cancerous T cells. Participants in the trial had been diagnosed with rare cancers - T cellacute lymphoblastic leukemiaor T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma - and had run out of treatment options after standard therapy proved ineffective for them. With the new immunotherapy, most of the patients in the study who received the full dose of cells achieved full remission of their cancer.

The trial's results were published May 30 in the journalBlood.

""For patients with these rare and aggressive cancers, who have no other options, this has the potential to become a transformative advance in the field,"" said senior author John F. DiPersio, MD, PhD, the Virginia E. & Sam J. Golman Professor of Medicine at WashU Medicine, who first developed the therapy in his lab at WashU Medicine. ""The trial demonstrated a high likelihood of response to the therapy and even remission. This CAR-T cell treatment shows promise in becoming a 'bridge-to-transplant' therapy for patients who would otherwise not be eligible for stem cell transplantation, which is the only potentially curative treatment for these blood cancers.""

Larger studies with more patients and longer follow-up are necessary before the researchers can determine whether this new therapy could be curative on its own.

The current trial included 28 adult and adolescent patients with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma that either returned after several lines of therapy or that never responded to treatment. About 1,000 people are diagnosed with these cancers annually in the U.S. If the cancer does not respond to treatment or returns after initial treatment, patients survive only six months, on average, and less than 7% are still living at the five-year mark.

The therapy, called WU-CART-007, was developed by Wugen, a WashU biotech startup company founded by DiPersio and other WashU Medicine investigators, including Matthew Cooper, PhD, who co-founded the company when he was on the WashU Medicine faculty and now serves as Wugen's chief scientific officer. The clinical trial was conducted in Australia, Europe and multiple sites across the U.S. For the St. Louis site, the trial was conducted at Siteman Cancer Center, based at Barnes-Jewish Hospital and WashU Medicine.

The trial design included a dose-escalation phase, which determined the recommended dose of therapeutic cells that patients would receive for the second phase of the trial. Dose escalation helps determine the largest dose of CAR-T cells that patients can receive and still have manageable side effects. Thirteen patients received the full dose of 900 million CAR-T cells after undergoing a procedure to clear the patients' own immune cells. This procedure - called lymphodepletion - reduces immune cells, making room for the new therapeutic T cells to establish themselves and expand in number. Two of these patients died from their cancer or treatment complications, such as infection, during the study period.

Of 11 patients who could be evaluated after treatment, the overall response rate was 91%, meaning 10 patients either showed no signs of cancer after treatment or their cancer cell burden was reduced significantly. Eight out of 11 patients (72.7%) achieved complete remission. At the study's data cut off, six who underwent a transplant remain in remission, with no evidence of disease, six to 12 months later.

Most patients (88.5%) experienced cytokine release syndrome as a side effect of the immunotherapy, and these cases were predominantly mild or moderate. Cytokine release syndrome is a common side effect of CAR-T cell therapy that occurs when large numbers of immune cells release chemicals that cause a full-body inflammatory response. About 19% of the patients experienced more-severe cytokine release syndrome. A small number of patients experienced rarer side effects, such as neurotoxicity syndrome and low-grade graft-versus-host disease. Adverse events were managed with additional therapies.

The immunotherapy evaluated in the trial is considered a ""universal"" CAR-T cell therapy because - harnessing CRISPR gene editing technology - it can be produced from cells donated by any healthy individual and used to treat any patient with a T cell cancer. In contrast, approved CAR-T cell therapies are adapted from the patient's immune cells. The cells must be collected from the patient and shipped to a manufacturing facility to be made and then shipped back, a process that typically takes three to six weeks. In contrast, universal CAR-T cell therapies can be made ahead of time, stored frozen and be readily available ""off-the-shelf,"" greatly reducing the wait time before therapy can begin.

Using CRISPR gene editing tools, the production process deletes the T cell receptor from the donor cells, greatly reducing the risk of graft-versus-host disease, in which donor T cells attack healthy tissue. Removing another key antigen also prevents the CAR-T cells from attacking one another. The types of rare cancers in this study presented a unique challenge: the therapeutic cells and the cancer cells are both T cells, so steps must be taken to prevent the therapeutic T cells from mistaking one another for the cancer and causing CAR-T cell fratricide. All other approved CAR-T cell therapies target B cell cancers, which do not have this T cell self-targeting complication. After using CRISPR gene editing to modify the CAR-T cells to prevent these harmful side effects, the cells are further engineered to target a protein called CD7 on the surface of cancerous T cells to then destroy the cancer.

""A larger international clinical trial of this therapy is already underway,"" DiPersio said. ""We must complete this larger trial first, but we are hopeful this universal CAR-T cell therapy can become an approved treatment for patients with deadly T cell cancers.""

Medicine,"In patients with diabetic foot ulcers that looked healed and met the current definition of a closed wound, closed ulcers with functionally defective skin that lost more body water were likely to re-open, according to a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) Diabetic Foot Consortium study, led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and published today inDiabetes Care.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently defines a closed wound as one where the surface is completely covered by new skin and has not had any discharge or drainage for two consecutive weeks.

But when it comes to wound healing, looks can be deceiving.

However, invisible wounds have a telltale sign: more moisture evaporates through this compromised barrier compared with healthy skin. This can be detected with a simple handheld point-of-care device that measures trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL).

""Diabetic foot ulcers are a major complication among patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. These wounds heal slowly and have high rates of recurrence, which often leads to amputation and death,"" said Sen. ""Our research shows that high TEWL of closed wounds, marking defective barrier function of the skin, is followed by wound recurrence.""

The new findings suggest that restoration of skin barrier functionality should be incorporated into the existing definition of wound closure to ensure durable wound closure and to better identify patients at risk of wound recurrence.

Across seven U.S. study sites of the NIH Diabetic Foot Consortium, the researchers - led by Sen, Gayle Gordillo, M.D., and Sashwati Roy, Ph.D., M.S. - recruited 418 adult participants with type 1 or 2 diabetes and who had a recently healed diabetic foot ulcer. Using a handheld device, they collected baseline TEWL measurements from the closed wound sites and then followed these patients for up to 16 weeks to check for wound recurrence.

Of the 368 participants who completed the study, 79, or 22%, had wounds that reopened by week 16. Baseline TEWL values were higher for wounds that would go on to reopen than for those that remained closed.

Further analysis identified that patients with high TEWL values - greater than 30 - were about 2.7 times more likely to have the wound reopen compared to those with lower TEWL levels. Time to recurrence was also shorter in wounds with high TEWL.

""Our study suggests that a TEWL of 30 in a healed wound should be considered a red flag for recurrence,"" said Gordillo, professor of plastic surgery at Pitt and senior medical director of UPMC Wound Healing Services. ""Even though these wounds may look closed, the barrier is defective, so these invisible wounds deserve further care.""

According to Sen, measuring TEWL as part of standard practice for assessing wound closure could lead to better outcomes for patients with diabetic foot ulcers and other types of wounds.

""This study is an important initial step to give clinicians treating diabetic foot ulcers a reliable diagnostic aid for the first time to assess an individual's risk of ulcer recurrence,"" said Teresa Jones, M.D. program director for the Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, & Metabolic Diseases at NIH's National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). ""Foot ulcers are such a confounding issue with diabetes and being able to determine which wounds are at highest risk for recurrence could save many lives and limbs.""

Additional research is needed to assess the impact of interventions for treatment of healed wounds with high TEWL.

Medicine,"New research has found that men who carry a common genetic variant are twice as likely to develop dementia in their lifetime compared to women.

The research, published inNeurology, used data from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial to investigate whether people who had variants in the haemochromatosis (HFE) gene, which is critical for regulating iron levels in the body, might be at increased risk of dementia.

Co-author Professor John Olynyk, from the Curtin Medical School, said one in three people carry one copy of the variant, known as H63D, while one in 36 carry two copies.

Professor Olynyk said further research was needed to investigate why this genetic variant increased the risk of dementia for males but not females.

""TheHFEgene is routinely tested for in most Western countries including Australia when assessing people for haemochromatosis – a disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron. Our findings suggest that perhaps this testing could be offered to men more broadly,"" Professor Olynyk said.

""While theHFEgene is critical for controlling iron levels in the body, we found no direct link between iron levels in the blood and increased dementia risk in affected men.

""This points to other mechanisms at play, possibly involving the increased risk of brain injury frominflammationand cell damage in the body.""

Co-author Professor Paul Lacaze, from Monash University, said the findings could help improve outcomes for people at risk of developing dementia.

""More than 400,000 Australians are currently living with dementia, with around a third of those being men. Understanding why men with the double H63D variant are at higher risk could pave the way for more personalised approaches to prevention and treatment,"" Professor Lacaze said.

""This study is a great example of how diverse Australian research groups and universities can collaborate effectively to learn more about these progressive diseases and ultimately improve health outcomes for people around the world.""

The ASPREE trial was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial of daily low-aspirin in 19,114 healthy older people in Australia and the USA. Primarily undertaken to evaluate the risks versus benefits of daily low-dose aspirin in this cohort, it created a treasure trove of healthy ageing data that has underpinned a wealth of research studies.

The research was a collaboration between Curtin University, Monash University, The University of Melbourne, The Royal Children's Hospital, Murdoch Children's Research Institute and Fiona Stanley Hospital."
Medicine,"Prevailing theories about why young people experience psychotic breaks at a young age rely on individual factors like exposure to child abuse, school bullying, or drugs.

But a new study from the NYU Silver School of Social Work suggests that broader social factors, such as racial inequality and experience with police violence, might contribute to the proportionately higher rates of psychosis seen among low-income young adults of color.

The study, ""Social Defeat and Psychosis in the United States,"" was published today bySchizophrenia Bulletinand authored by NYU Silver associate professor Jordan DeVylder and doctoral students Jacqueline Cosse and Brianna Amos.

The researchers culled the National Survey of Poly-Victimization and Mental Health to explore individual-level and societal, or structural, impacts on early psychosis risk. The sample included 1,584 U.S. participants aged 18-29.

Among the respondents, Blacks, Latinos, multiracial, and Indigenous respondents had 60% higher odds of reporting having experienced one or more psychotic episodes in the prior year compared to white respondents, the study determined.

Furthermore, those who cited an experience involving police violence in had 52% higher odds of reporting one or more delusional or hallucinatory episode in the prior year.

The most widely recognized risk factors for psychosis are spelled out in the ""Social Defeat Hypothesis,"" an influential theoretical framework used by psychiatrists to treat young adults with psychosis. While the social defeat hypothesis frames risk factors around the impact on the individual, the study shifts the focus to take in account social systems and structural factors.

In the study's analysis of the U.S. survey, an individual's sense of ""social defeat"" can indeed result in psychotic symptoms and can arise from a high frequency of substance use or exposure to bullying, as the theory holds. But the persistence of racial inequality, and related experiences such as exposure to police violence, could also be relevant factors, according to the study. It calls for research into the impact of societal factors that are more prominent in low-income and marginalized communities.

Developed in Northern Europe, the ""Social Defeat Hypothesis"" has been used by U.S. psychiatrists for over two decades to understand the development of psychosis, a condition that could show a young adult to be at higher risk of suicidal thinking or even schizophrenia.

Under the hypothesis, social defeats, like feeling humiliated, contribute to long-term neurobiological shifts in the brain and dopamine system especially, and are part of what may bring on instances in which an individual loses touch with reality.

In conducting the study, DeVylder, Cosse, and Amos collaborated extensively with fellow social work scholar Lisa Fedina of the University of Michigan, as well as additional NYU Silver doctoral students.

Commenting on findings' significance, DeVylder said that structural factors may exert a ""substantial"" influence on an individual risk for psychosis, and could potentially help explain ethno-racial disparities in psychosis in the U.S."
Medicine,"This study investigates upper gastrointestinal tract (UGIT) involvement in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), a condition traditionally considered limited to the colon. Although extra-colonic manifestations of UC are well recognized, UGIT issues have received less attention. This research aimed to document the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological UGIT findings in adults with UC and assess their association with disease severity and extent.

This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at Ain Shams University over one year. A total of 78 UC patients underwent comprehensive clinical evaluations, including assessments of gastrointestinal complaints, medication history, disease progression, surgeries, and physical examinations. Endoscopic assessments of both the UGIT and colon were performed, accompanied by biopsies for histopathological analysis.

The study population had a mean age of 35.26 years, with a nearly equal gender distribution. Endoscopic findings revealed significant UGIT involvement: 64% of patients had esophagitis and/or gastroesophageal reflux disease, 93% had gastritis, and 80% had duodenitis. Histopathological findings showed notableinflammation, basal cell hyperplasia, and ulcerations in the esophagus, with 51.3% of patients exhibiting chronic gastritis and 38.5% testing positive forHelicobacter pyloriinfection. Statistical analysis demonstrated a strong association between colonic disease severity and UGIT endoscopic (p< 0.0001 andp< 0.001 in the esophagus and stomach, respectively) and histopathological (p< 0.004,p< 0.001, andp<0.005 in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum, respectively) findings, particularly in patients with UGIT symptoms.

The current study concluded that endoscopic and histopathological changes in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenal mucosa are common in Egyptian UC patients. The study has established an association between UC and the endoscopic and histopathological findings in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. We recommend conducting a UGIT endoscopy examination for UC patients to diagnose any present UGIT lesions. The results of this study provide a rationale for conducting multicenter controlled studies with a larger number of Egyptian UC patients to confirm these findings."
Medicine,"First-line treatment with the triplet combination of encorafenib, cetuximab and mFOLFOX6 significantly improved survival compared to the standard of care in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, according to new data from the Phase III BREAKWATER trial led by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

The findings, presented today at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, demonstrated significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to standard chemotherapy-based regimens. The median PFS was 12.8 months with the triplet combination compared to 7.1 months in the standard-of-care group, and the median OS was 30.3 months compared with 15.1 months, respectively.

Colorectal cancer affects more than 150,000 individuals annually in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Institute. BRAF mutations, present in approximately 8 to 12% of colorectal cancer cases, are associated with a distinct molecular subtype characterized by aggressive tumor biology, limited responsiveness to standard-of-care chemotherapy, and poor clinical outcomes, with median OS typically under 12 months.

Encorafenib and cetuximab are targeted therapies designed to counteract the activity of proteins that drive cancer progression when BRAF V600E mutations are present. Chemotherapy regimen mFOLFOX6 is commonly used in treating colorectal cancer. Standard treatments typically involve chemotherapy without targeted BRAF inhibition.

The safety data from this trial continues to show that the triplet therapy regimen caused Grade 3 or higher adverse events in more than half the patients, although the adverse events were largely reversible.

The trial reinforces the importance of routine molecular profiling to guide early targeted therapy selection for colorectal cancer patients. Similarly, a research team led by Kopetz was awarded a $23 million grant from Advance Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to advance innovative research to understand how colorectal cancer changes in response to treatment over time. The researchers aim to collect tissue and blood samples from metastatic colorectal cancer patients, along with response data, over time in order to better understand and combat treatment resistance.

The study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc., and Kopetz disclosed consulting for Pfizer and receiving research funding from the company."
Medicine,"Emerging theories suggest that communication challenges arise from differing perspectives between autistic and non-autistic partners rather than individual socio-cognitive deficits. In addition, while social behavior varies between cultures, observations from Western cultures dominate our understanding of autism. Researchers from Japan and the UK have conducted a cross-cultural analysis comparing the mentalizing performance of British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults. Their study highlights the need for more culturally sensitive socio-cognitive measures to assess autistic traits.

Autism spectrum disorders are associated with difficulties in social communication, long attributed to individual socio-cognitive deficits. As a consequence of this perspective, stigma and pressure to conform to neurotypical social norms often lead to mental health challenges among autistic individuals. Emerging theories suggest that communication difficulties may rather arise from mismatches in perspectives between autistic and non-autistic partners. Addressing this mismatch collaboratively could transform the understanding of autism and improve communication outcomes.

Social behavior also varies significantly across cultures. Gestures, eye contact, and body language that are considered appropriate in one culture may be perceived differently in another. Nevertheless, current socio-cognitive assessments largely reflect Western norms, limiting their applicability to non-Western populations.

To bridge this gap, researchers from Japan conducted a cross-cultural analysis to compare mentalizing difficulties, or challenges in understanding the thoughts and feelings of others, in British and Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults. Led by Dr. Bianca Schuster, a researcher at Waseda University, Japan, with co-authors Associate Professor Yuko Okamoto and Professor Rieko Osu from Waseda University, Professor Hirotaka Kosaka from the University of Fukui, and Dr. Masakazu Ide from the National Rehabilitation Center for Persons With Disabilities, the study highlights the importance of considering neurodivergent perspectives rather than attributing difficulties solely to autistic individuals.

Explaining the rationale behind their work, Dr. Schuster says,""Autistic and non-autistic people have different experiences and therefore perceive and interact with the world differently. Such a mismatch in perspectives can lead to difficulties in understanding each other's respective social cues – a problem termed the 'double empathy problem.' This theory has received a lot of attention in recent years, but there are still very few studies that have formally tested it.""Their findings were published in Volume 16 ofMolecular Autismon May 14, 2025.

The researchers used animations showing social scenes, depicted by moving triangles, and asked participants to interpret what was happening. They found that non-autistic British adults struggled to interpret animations created by their autistic peers. In contrast, British autistic adults demonstrated similar performances when interpreting animations made by both autistic and non-autistic people. The fact that British autistic adults did not perform better with animations made by their own neurotype may reflect that, in comparison to neurotypical groups, the perspectives of British neurodivergent individuals may be too varied.

Conversely, Japanese autistic and non-autistic adults interpreted animations created by their own and the respective other group with comparable accuracy. Notably, cross-cultural analyses revealed that while there was no difference in performance between Japanese and British non-autistic adults, Japanese autistic participants outperformed both groups of British participants. In addition, animations created by Japanese autistic adults were interpreted with higher accuracy by all autistic participants. Nevertheless, motor performance was comparable across all participants.

Overall, these findings support a paradigm shift toward treating autism as a different way of experiencing and interpreting the world, while recognizing it as a social disability shaped by challenges within a predominantly neurotypical environment. An inclusive environment that values socially diverse behaviors can support autistic individuals and enhance their mental well-being. Furthermore, the observed results do not likely mean that Japanese people are better at mentalizing than British individuals, because real-world difficulties in communication and social understanding do exist between autistic and non-autistic people in Japan, too. Instead, the findings may indicate that the task used in the current study may not be sensitive enough to detect mentalizing differences in the Japanese culture, highlighting the need to develop more culturally sensitive research and diagnostic tools.

""Cultural differences related to the diagnosis of autism may be subtle but can still lead to misclassification of cases and therefore have a significant impact on the lives of individuals. The results of this study highlight the urgent need for culturally inclusive research and the development of diagnostic criteria and tools that accurately reflect and respect the diverse manifestations of autism in different cultural contexts.""Dr. Schuster adds."
Medicine,"Over 10 million infants under six month old may currently be underweight, according to a new analysis of data collected across low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

The study, published inBMJ Global Healthand led by researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and the Emergency Nutrition Network (ENN), estimated the burden of malnutrition among infants using survey data collected across 56 countries.

The study analysed data on over 50,000 children under six months gathered through Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) collected across West & Central Africa, Eastern & Central Africa, Latin America & the Caribbean, East Asia & the Pacific, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, and South Asia.

The DHS are nationally-representative household surveys conducted across LMICs every five years or so, and include data on the current weight, height (or length), age and weight at birth for infants. Once collected, the data is made available for researchers worldwide to analyse.

In the study, infants with a low weight-for-age score (WAZ) were classed as underweight, infants with a low weight-for-length score (WLZ) were classed as too thin, showing signs of wasting, and infants with a low length-for-age score (LAZ) were classed as too small in length for their age. These are all globally-recognised indicators of malnutrition.

Across all of the countries measured, 17.4% of infants under the age of six months were clinically underweight, 15.5% showed signs of wasting, 19.9% were small in length for their age (stunted) and 15% were underweight at birth.

When applied to the current population across all LMICs globally, these estimates suggest that approximately 10.3 million infants are underweight, 9.2 million are wasted, 11.8 million are stunted and 8.9 million have been born with a low birth weight.

Malnutrition in infants under six months is a major global health problem, and can be devastating for families and communities. These infants are at high risk of death, illness and poor development in the short term, and have a higher risk of non-communicable disease (including heart disease) in later life. Some studies have also shown that the long-term effects of malnutrition can be intergenerational.

Marie McGrath, Technical Director at the Emergency Nutrition Network (ENN) and PhD student at LSHTM, and co-author of the study, said:""Big numbers sometimes dehumanise. Behind every one of the surveys we analysed is a personal tragedy. There is a baby suffering and devastated families experiencing daily worry and loss. As a society, how can we be complacent and shy away from babies facing increased risk of death in their first months of life?

""The good news is that health services are primed to act. Growth monitoring - that helps identify underweight babies - is recommended in national health services worldwide. Babies born too early or too small need close follow-up and first vaccination at 6 weeks is a critical time to measure.

""National health services need direct investment in equipment, training and mentoring on identifying and managing these cases. Let's reinvest, not reinvent. Using one indicator - underweight - is consistent across newborn, malnutrition and health communities and simpler for health workers. Let's work together to assess, appraise and act.""

As this is an observational study using survey data, it only looks at a snapshot of the situation in each country. The team believe that the true number of infants experiencing malnutrition may be greater, as data on other indicators of malnutrition such as mid upper arm circumference or swelling were not available and some surveys were up to 10 years old.

They also suggest that underweight scores (low weight-for-age) may be a better indicator of malnutrition compared to typically used low weight-for-length, due to higher data quality and stronger links to health risks. This supports the recently updated World Health Organization malnutrition guidelines, which now include underweight as a criteria for enrolment in supportive nutrition and health care for infants under six months."
Medicine,"Dengue fever caused by a flavivirus named DENV is a major global health challenge, risking almost half of the world's population. Since the early 20thcentury, the scientific community has faced multiple challenges to develop effective dengue vaccines. This spanned a variety of techniques - from the use of ox bile to weaken DENV to the chemical processing of DENV-infected mosquitoes! However, the limitations of these techniques and the urgent need to save millions of people from the infection in its endemic regions, led to the development of more sophisticated dengue vaccines.

In a recent review published inPediatric Investigationon 15 April 2025, lead authors Professor Kevin C. Kain from the University of Toronto, Canada, and Dr. Ran Wang, Associate Professor at the Capital Medical University, China, discuss the current status and implications of dengue vaccines like CYD-TDV, TAK-003, and Butantan-DV while exploring the challenges in Dengue vaccine development like ADE, and proposes future directions in this field.DENV has four serotypes (DENV-1 to DENV-4) and triggers both protective and pathogenic immune responses. Serotype-specific immune responses are typical when infected for the first time, whereas secondary infection may lead to more severe dengue due to ADE. ""ADE is initiated when immune complexes of DENV and IgG antibodies bind to Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on myeloid cells. This suppresses antiviral defenses and enhances viral replication,""explains Professor Kain. This is an important aspect to consider while designing vaccines for dengue.The review draws from insights and implications from three Dengue vaccines—CYD-TDV (Dengvaxia) was the first licensed dengue vaccine and showed efficacy in phase III clinical trials. However, it was found to have reduced protection against DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. Moreover, this vaccine was only recommended for individuals with confirmed prior DENV infection, limiting its practical application. Further, vaccination regime of three doses over 12 months, was particularly difficult to achieve in resource-limited settings. Due to these reasons, CYD-TDV was withdrawn from widespread use, although the WHO still recommends it for individuals aged 9-45 years with prior DENV infection.The second vaccine—TAK-003 - was evaluated over a four-and-a-half-year-long Phase III trial across eight countries where Dengue is endemic. With an overall efficacy of 61.2% (against current dengue infection) and 84.1% (against hospitalized cases), it offered strong protection against DENV-1 and DENV-2 serotypes. But, due to the insufficient number of cases of the other two serotypes, TAK-003's efficacy against these could not be evaluated. This vaccine has a two-dose regimen, presenting logistical challenges as in the case of CYD-TDV.Contrary to the above cases, the Butantan-DV vaccine with its single-dose regimen proved to have an edge over the others in simplifying vaccination where healthcare facilities were limited. Dr. Wang explains further about this vaccine, ""A 2-year analysis reported an overall efficacy of 73.6% in sero-naïve individuals and 89.2% in those with prior dengue exposure, with protection against DENV-1 (89.5%) and DENV-2 (69.6%)"". Also, in a study that spanned more than 3 years, Butantan-DV demonstrated an 89% decrease in severe dengue and dengue with warning signs. However,the efficacy ofthis vaccine against DENV-3 and DENV-4 is yet to be established. Although the current dengue vaccines exhibit effective reduction of severe and fatal dengue in clinical trials, their impact on individuals aged above 60 years is still unclear.The possibility of severe dengue after vaccination has been a significant challenge, particularly thought to be driven by ADE. When non-neutralizing, cross-reactive antibodies recognize conserved epitopes on the DENV envelope protein, it triggers immune responses that weaken antiviral activity, leading to severe disease. ""Understanding the role of conserved epitopes and FcγR signaling in ADE is crucial for dengue vaccine development, and ADE issues in real world may only be revealed through efficacy studies in phase IV clinical trials of vaccines"", comments Professor Kain.Looking ahead, global collaboration among researchers, health agencies, and vaccine developers will be essential to advance dengue vaccine research. Future efforts should explore diverse platforms like mRNA vaccines and focus on avoiding ADE. Priorities include: 1) Phase IV trials to refine strategies, 2) vaccines adaptable across populations and serotypes, and 3) region-specific formulations targeting local DENV variants.With global collaboration, advanced vaccine platforms, and a better understanding of ADE, we may finally be on the path toward eliminating dengue."
Medicine,"Researchers at the Ragon Institute have made a significant discovery about how antibodies can directly enhance the body's ability to fightMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb), the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis (TB). Despite decades of research, TB remains one of the deadliest infectious diseases worldwide, with about 10 million new cases and 1.6 million deaths annually. Currently, there is no highly effective vaccine, highlighting the urgent need for new insights and treatments.

In a study published today inImmunity, Ragon faculty member Galit Alter, PhD and previous post-doctoral trainee Patricia Grace, PhD, now at University of Pittsburgh, partnered with Bryan Bryson, PhD, associate member Sarah Fortune, PhD and a team of collaborators, to collect the largest library of monoclonal antibodies toMycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis. The team identified specific antibody features that significantly limit the growth ofMtb. This research reveals critical new insights into how antibodies interact with immune cells in the lungs to restrict Mtb infection, laying the groundwork for potential antibody-based therapies or vaccines against tuberculosis, both of which are urgently needed.

The team investigated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), highly specialized antibodies engineered to target specific components ofMtb. They screened a broad library of these antibodies, targeting many different components of the bacteria, to determine which could effectively reduce bacterial growth in infected mice. They found that particular antibodies targeting different parts of the bacteria-both surface proteins and internal antigens-could effectively restrictMtbgrowth, challenging previous assumptions that only antibodies recognizing surface structures could help fight TB.

To better understand the mechanisms behind this antibody-mediated protection, researchers closely examined one particularly effective antibody targeting a molecule called lipoarabinomannan (LAM), found on the bacterial cell surface. By engineering the antibody constant domain (Fc), to control the killing activities of the antibody, the researchers discovered that maximal bacterial control was achieved when antibodies redirected innate immune cell recruitment and activation. Particularly, antibodies able to redirect the bacteria to neutrophils provided the greatest level of protection.

This discovery highlights a previously unrecognized way antibodies can work against TB not merely by neutralizing pathogens directly, but by reshaping immune cell functions within infected tissues. Given the rise in antibiotic resistant bacteria, understanding these immune mechanisms opens new avenues for novel therapeutic and vaccine design that are urgently needed to combat TB. Moreover, this study unlocks future approaches to rapidly discover and design monoclonal therapeutics to a broader array of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the future."
Medicine,"Heart attacks are the leading cause of death globally, yet some statistics from many different countries suggest these events declined in frequency since the COVID-19 pandemic.Mass General Brigham researchers evaluated whether these cardiac trends reflect a true change in event rates, or if they reflect that more people are dying at home rather than in hospitals. Their findings highlight potential shortcomings of cardiac care during and in the years following the height of the pandemic, suggesting opportunities to better treat and prevent cardiac events in people at risk. The study published today inJAMA Network Open.

The researchers looked at death certificate data from 127,746 people who died in Massachusetts and found cardiac deaths exceeded anticipated levels between 2020 and 2023. Using data from 2014 to 2019, the team set an expected cardiac death rate to compare the new 2020 to 2023 rate against. Cardiac deaths were 16% higher than expected in 2020, 17% higher in 2021 and 2022, and 6% higher in 2023. Notably, this significant increase in cardiac deaths happened despite lower cardiac-related hospital admissions, meaning more deaths occurred at home.

""Healthcare systems around the world have experienced multiple shocks since 2020. Our findings suggest that both patient choices about seeking care and outcomes after experiencing a cardiac emergency also have changed,"" said senior author John Hsu, MD, MBA, MSCE, faculty member and director of the Program for Clinical Economics and Policy Analysis at the Mongan Institute at MGH. ""Had we not examined mortality using death certificate data, the increases in population cardiac mortality could have gone unnoticed."""
Medicine,"Many men with aggressive prostate cancer can experience a high rate of recurrence despite treatment.

A new Phase 2 clinical trial at UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center unveiled clues as to why these patients are doing poorly and may offer hope in the form of targeted therapy.

The findings will be presented at the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) conference on June 3 in Chicago. .

UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center is testing a drug called niraparib (ZEJULA), given before prostate cancer surgery. Researchers think it could enable more personalized treatments- especially for men with prostate cancer that has specific DNA repair gene mutations.

The pilot trial (NCT04030559) looked at whether giving the PARP inhibitor niraparib before surgery could help prevent cancer from returning in men with aggressive prostate cancer.

A total of11 men with high-risk prostate cancer and certain biomarkers, specifically gene mutations, took part in the study. Each patient received 200 mg of niraparib daily for 90 days before undergoing surgery.

The study group had a median age of 68 years and a median prostate-specificantigen(PSA) at diagnosis of 10.7 ng/mL. Genetic alterations included germline mutations in BRCA2, MSH6, and CHEK2, and somatic mutations in ATM, SPOP, KMT2C, KMT2D, among others. Germline mutations in DNA are inherited while somatic mutations happen after conception.

While the drug didn't dramatically shrink tumors before surgery, the study showed the potential of using genetic testing and blood-based monitoring to better understand and track prostate cancer. Notably, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)biomarkeranalysis proved useful in tracking tumor evolution and resistance mechanisms in real time. ctDNA is small fragments of DNA that cancer cells release into the bloodstream.

The research team is now continuing to analyze the data to better understand why some cancers resist treatment and how to design future therapies that are more tailored to each individual.

Medicine,"People who are at higher risk for heart disease also seem more likely to develop dementia.And research led by The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UT Health San Antonio) has discovered new associations between various lipid, or fat, levels in the blood and the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, the most common cause of dementia worldwide.The findings mean that using blood lipid profiles could help better understand, predict and possibly even prevent the disease in the future.In more than 800 older adults who were part of the long-running Framingham Heart Study, the researchers found that higher levels of small dense cholesterol particles – which are known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease – were associated with higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.However, higher levels of a marker for small fat-carrying particles, which are involved in the transport of dietary fats from the gut to other body tissues through the blood after eating, were associated with lower risk of developing the disease.Perhaps ironically, the researchers also discovered that individuals who had the lowest levels of highly dense cholesterol particles – often referred to as ""good cholesterol"" as it is considered protective against cardiovascular disease – had a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease compared to the rest of the included individuals.

Charisis is first author of the study published May 30 in the journalNeurology, titled, ""Association of Blood Lipoprotein Levels With Incident Alzheimer's Disease in Community-Dwelling Individuals: The Framingham Heart Study."" Other authors include corresponding author Sudha Seshadri, MD, director of the Biggs Institute, and researchers from Boston University School of Public Health, the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and the Framingham Heart Study.

The new study notes that dementia is a leading source of morbidity and mortality in the aging population. Worldwide, there were 57.4 million people living with dementia in 2019, a number that is expected to reach 152.8 million by 2050.However, there is a general trend over time of decreasing incidence of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias in the U.S. and other higher-income countries that is at least partially attributed to better management of cardiovascular risk factors.The Framingham Heart Study is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that was launched in 1948 inFramingham, Massachusetts. Residents there ages 30 to 59 were randomly selected from census data to participate. Those with definite signs of cardiovascular disease at baseline were excluded. Participants of the original cohort have undergone up to 32 examinations performed every two years, which have included detailed history-taking by a physician, a physical examination and lab testing.The latest analysis by researchers led by UT Health San Antonio included participants from the original cohort who were 60 years or older and free of dementia during an examination period of 1985-1988, and had available cognitive follow-up and lipoprotein marker data. Lipoproteins act as a transport system for lipids in the bloodstream.

Levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or good cholesterol; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or ""bad cholesterol""; small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C); and other lipoprotein types associated with heart disease were measured in blood samples obtained from the mid- to late-'80s examination period. The Framingham participants were watched for incident Alzheimer's disease, meaning a first diagnosis of the disease, until 2020.Of a total of 822 participants, 128 developed incident Alzheimer's disease.The researchers discovered that an increase of 1 standard deviation unit (SDU) of a concentration of small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C), a value representing how far a specific data point deviates from the mean, was associated with a 21% increase in the risk for incident Alzheimer's disease.As the name implies, small dense LDL-C (sdLDL-C) is a type of the so-called bad cholesterol with smaller and denser particles than other low-density lipoproteins, and that is considered more likely to form plaque in arteries, strongly associated with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.A 1 SDU increase in a concentration of ApoB48, a lipoprotein that transports dietary fat from the intestines and into the bloodstream that also is tied to heart disease and cardiovascular problems, was found to be associated with a 22% decrease in the risk for incident Alzheimer's disease.Participants in the first quartile of HDL-C, or good cholesterol – in order of lesser amounts – were 44% less likely to develop Alzheimer's compared with those in the second, third and fourth quartiles. And those with small dense LDL-C concentrations below the median were 38% less likely to develop Alzheimer's compared with those with concentrations above the median.In summary, then, lower small-density bad cholesterol (sdLDL-C) concentrations and higher ApoB48 concentrations were associated with a lower Alzheimer's risk. And individuals with the lowest good cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were less likely to develop Alzheimer's compared with the remaining sample.""These findings underscore links between lipoprotein metabolism pathways and Alzheimer's risk, emphasizing the potential role of blood lipoprotein markers in Alzheimer's risk stratification and of lipid modification strategies in dementia prevention,"" the researchers concluded."
Medicine,"On World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) today launches a new publication and calls on governments to urgently ban all flavors in tobacco and nicotine products, including cigarettes, pouches, hookahs and e-cigarettes to protect youth from addiction and disease.

Flavors like menthol, bubble gum and cotton candy are masking the harshness of tobacco and nicotine products turning toxic products into youth-friendly bait. flavors not only make it harder to quit but have also been linked to serious lung diseases. Cigarettes, which still kill up to half of their users, also come in flavors or can have flavors added to them.

""Flavors are fuelling a new wave of addiction, and should be banned,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. ""They undermine decades of progress in tobacco control. Without bold action, the global tobacco epidemic, already killing around 8 million people each year, will continue to be driven by addiction dressed up with appealing flavors.""

The publication, flavor accessories in tobacco products enhance attractiveness and appeal reveals how flavors and accessories like capsule filters and click-on drops are marketed to bypass regulations and hook new users.

Flavors are a leading reason why young people try tobacco and nicotine products. Paired with flashy packaging and social media-driven marketing, they've increased the appeal of nicotine pouches, heated tobacco, and disposable vapes into addictive and harmful products, which aggressively target young people.

WHO reiterates that tobacco products, including heated tobacco products expose users to cancer-causing chemicals and should be strictly regulated.

According to recent data, the Region of the Americas currently has the second highest prevalence of tobacco use among adolescents aged 13 to 15 years, with 11.9% of boys and 10.7% of girls reporting use. The region also shows the smallest gender gap, indicating a concerning equalization in consumption patterns. At the same time, the use of electronic cigarettes is on the rise, particularly among adolescents and youth. In this age group, the regional average for e-cigarette use stands at 5.4%, a figure alarmingly close to the prevalence of conventional cigarette use, which is 6%.

In response to this situation, countries in the Americas have made progress in implementing effective measures to reduce tobacco use and counter the strategies employed by the tobacco industry. Ten Member States have adopted comprehensive bans on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship, some of which also cover emerging products such as electronic cigarettes. In addition, seven countries have completely banned the sale of these products.

As a result of these efforts and the implementation of measures outlined in the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), it is estimated that the number of tobacco users in the Region has declined from 159 million in the year 2000 to 129 million in 2025—an 18.87% reduction. This downward trend reflects the positive impact of regulations such as 100% smoke-free environments and graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging, as well as growing awareness of the harmful effects of tobacco on health, the economy, and the environment.

World No Tobacco Day was created by WHO Member States in 1987 and is observed annually on May 31 to raise awareness about the harmful effects of tobacco use. This year's campaign aims to expose industry strategies that manipulate the appearance and appeal of tobacco and nicotine products. By unmasking these tactics, the initiative seeks to raise awareness, promote policy change, and reduce demand, especially among youth."
Medicine,"A new artificial intelligence (AI) test can identify which men with prostate cancer will benefit most from the life-extending drug abiraterone, in clinical trial results presented by scientists from UCL and the Institute of Cancer Research.

The researchers analyzed prostate cancer tumour samples from men with high-risk prostate cancer that had not spread, who took part in the STAMPEDE trial. Using the new AI test, they found that abiraterone given alongside standard hormone therapy almost halves the risk of death for approximately 25% of men with this type of cancer.

However, since many men do well with standard therapy, there is a need to better select those who would gain the most benefit.

Experts say that because fewer men than previously thought will need the drug, NHS England should review the decision not to fund the treatment for this group of men.

Abiraterone, discovered in the UK at The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), works by inhibiting the production of the hormone testosterone in all tissues throughout the body, including in the tumour.

It is approved for use on the NHS in England for patients with advanced prostate cancer that has come back and spread to other parts of the body, but not for the 8,400 men per year with newly diagnosed, high-risk prostate cancer that has not yet spread. However, it has been available for men with this indication in Scotland and Wales for two years.

The new test, developed by Artera Inc., uses AI to study images of tumour samples and spot features that are invisible to the human eye.

The researchers used the test onbiopsyimages from more than 1,000 men who took part in the STAMPEDE trial. Patients were given a score - eitherbiomarker-positive or biomarker-negative - that was compared to the outcomes of their illness.

For patients with biomarker-positive tumours, abiraterone cut the risk of death after five years from 17% to 9%.

For those with biomarker-negative tumours, risk of death without abiraterone was 7%, which was cut to 4% with abiraterone - a difference that was not statistically or clinically significant. These men would therefore benefit from standard therapy alone and could avoid unnecessary treatment and the additional side effects that come with it.

Professor Nick James, co-lead of the trial from the Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Abiraterone has already hugely improved the outlook for hundreds of thousands of men with advanced prostate cancer. We know that for many men with cancer that has not yet spread, it can also have spectacular results. But it does come with side effects and requires additional monitoring for potential issues with high blood pressure or liver abnormalities. It can also slightlyincrease the risk of diabetesand heart attacks, so knowing who is most likely to benefit is very valuable.

""This research shows that we can pick out the people who will respond best to abiraterone, and those who will do well from standard treatment alone - hormone therapy and radiotherapy.

""Access to this life-extending drug is currently a postcode lottery - with those living in Scotland and Wales able to receive the treatment for free. The NHS in England has previously decided that it would be too expensive to offer the drug. Since the patent expired in 2022, abiraterone costs just £77 per pack - compared with the thousands of pounds that new drugs cost. Previous research by my team has shown that preventing cancer relapses for these men would save more money than the drug costs to purchase. I truly hope that this new research - showing precisely who needs the drug to live well for longer - will lead to NHS England reviewing their decision to fund abiraterone for high-risk prostate cancer that has not spread.""

Dr Matthew Hobbs, Director of Research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: ""STAMPEDE has driven huge improvements in prostate cancer treatment over the past decade. But we recognised that the samples and data from men in the trial represented an untapped resource and a way to deliver the sort of precision treatment we have seen benefiting patients with other cancers for years.

""To unlock that potential, Prostate Cancer UK, in partnership with Movember, awarded £1.4m to lead the way in getting a more precise understanding of prostate cancer, including by using AI tools. Today's results show that our strategic investment is now delivering exactly what we were aiming for: tools that identify men most likely to benefit from a treatment.

""Prostate Cancer UK has been calling on the UK Government to approve this life-saving, cost-effective drug for over two years. These exciting results suggest a way to make this an even more cost-effective approach. We therefore echo the researchers' urgent call for abiraterone to be made available to those men whose lives it can save - men who, thanks to this research, we can now identify more precisely than ever before.""

Giles Turner, 64, who lives in Brighton, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 2023. He has been taking abiraterone for almost two years and has spent £20,000 on his treatment so far. He said: ""This is great research and adds even more reason for NHS England to start funding this treatment now. I find it very difficult to come to terms with having to pay for this treatment, whereas if I was with the NHS in Scotland or Wales I would not. Even more important are the thousands of men in England who are missing out on this cheap, life-saving and cost-saving drug. Action must be taken by NHS England and the government right now.""

The trial results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting 2025. This current research received funding from Artera Inc., UK Medical Research Council and Prostate Cancer UK. The STAMPEDE trial is coordinated by the Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Trials Unit at UCL and is funded by Cancer Research UK."
Medicine,"Researchers from Mass General Brigham will present research discoveries and outcomes from clinical trials in cancer at the 2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, held May 30-June 3, in Chicago.

ASCO brings together leading experts in clinical oncology to share the latest breakthroughs in cancer research, science and medicine. Presentations from Mass General Brigham investigators include an update on the INCIPIENT trial (using CAR-T in patients with glioblastoma), advances in skin cancer and gynecologic cancer treatment, a new way to radiate multiple brain metastases at the same time, and an app created to help caregivers handle the psychosocial impacts of cancer treatment.

Below are a few highlights from this year's presentations. All times are in Central Time (CT).

Psychosocial digital application for caregivers of patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): A randomized controlled trial

When:Friday, May 30, 2025, 1:00-1:12 pm

Who:Jamie M. Jacobs, PhD, Mass General Hospital

What:This work will simultaneously be published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (JCO).

Caregivers (i.e., relatives and friends) of patients undergoing HSCT struggle with considerable quality of life (QOL) impairments and psychological strain before, during and after HSCT. However, few interventions address the supportive care needs of these caregivers while prioritizing accessibility and scalability. The team assessedthe efficacy ofa self-guided digital application, called BMTCARE App, for improving HSCT caregivers' QOL, burden, mood symptoms, coping skills, and self-efficacy. The researchers conducted a single-center randomized trial of the BMT-CARE App for HSCT caregivers, compared with usual care. The team concluded that the BMT-CARE App, a psychosocial digital health intervention, led to substantial improvements in QOL, caregiving burden, depression and PTSD symptoms, and coping skills in caregivers of HSCT recipients.

Immunological correlates from phase I study of CARv3-TEAM-E in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM): INCIPIENT trial

When:Friday, May 30, 2025, 5:09-5:21 pm

Who:Bryan D. Choi, MD, PhD, Mass General Hospital

What:Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells for glioblastoma (GBM) have been limited by the challenge of targeting a single tumor antigen in a heterogeneous disease. To address this barrier, the team generated a novel engineered T-cell product (CARv3-TEAM-E) that targets the EGFRvIII antigen while also secreting T-cell-Engaging Antibody Molecules (TEAMs) against wild-type EGFR. The INCIPIENT clinical trial is a first-in-human study of CARv3-TEAM-E in patients with recurrent GBM (NCT05660369). Patients were treated with intraventricular CARv3-TEAM-E T cells (10E6 cells per infusion). The results found that CAR T cells were detected in the CSF of all patients for an average of 33.6 days (SD= 10.33). Granulocytes, NK cells, B cells, and monocytes appeared in the CSF immediately after infusion, decreasing to low levels over the course of several weeks.

Rapid Oral Abstract (2017) Session: Safety and tolerability of intraventricular CARv3-TEAM-E T cells following lymphodepleting chemotherapy in recurrent glioblastoma: INCIPIENT trial

When:Saturday, May 31, 2025, 3:42-3:48 pm

Who:Elizabeth R. Gerstner, MD, Mass General Hospital

What:CAR T therapy is a novel, promising approach in glioblastoma (GBM) but tumor heterogeneity can limit efficacy when a single antigen is targeted. The team designed a second-generation CAR T molecule that targets epidermal growth factor receptor vIII (EGFRvIII) and also secretes a T-cell–engaging antibody molecule (TEAM) against wild-type EGFR. In a phase 1, first-in-human study (INCIPIENT, NCT05660369), patients with recurrent GBM with EGFRvIIImutationand/or EGFR amplification were eligible to receive up to 6 intraventricular doses of 10x106 CAR T cells via Ommaya catheter after lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide. The results found that CAR T manufacturing was successful for all patients.

Stereotactic radiation versus hippocampal avoidance whole brain radiation in patients with 5-20 brain metastases: A multicenter, phase 3 randomized trial

When:Sunday, June 1, 2025, 10:33-10:45 am

Who:Ayal A. Aizer, MD, Brigham and Women's Hospital

What:Radiation therapy forms the mainstay of management for patients with brain metastases.Published randomized trials have found improved quality of life with stereotactic radiation (SRS/SRT) over whole brain radiation (WBRT) in patients with ≤4 brain metastases; comparative trials in patients with >4 brain metastases are lacking. Accordingly, Dr. Aizer and team conducted a multicenter, phase 3 randomized trial comparing SRS/SRT to hippocampal avoidance WBRT (HA-WBRT) in patients with 5-20 brain metastases. The primary endpoint was the average of patient-reported symptom severity and interference in function over the first six months post-baseline relative to baseline. This trial found that patients with 5-20 brain metastases experience fewer symptoms and less interference in function after SRS/SRT as opposed to HA-WBRT, without compromise of survival, supporting SRS/SRT as the standard of care in this population.

Rapid Oral Abstract (5511) Session: Primary results of a phase 2 study of cisplatin-sensitized radiation therapy and pembrolizumab for unresectable vulvar cancer.

When:Tuesday, June 3, 2025, 8:12-8:18 am

Who:Oladapo O. Yeku, MD, PhD, Mass General Hospital

What:Locally advanced vulvar cancer is a rare but lethal disease more common in underserved populations. In contrast to other gynecologic cancers, the incidence and mortality of this disease has increased over the past decade.This research team hypothesized that immune checkpoint inhibitors could synergize with chemotherapy and improve outcomes for this disease. In this single-arm phase II trial (NCT04430699) patients with primary unresectable, incompletely resected, recurrent, or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva undergoing radiation therapy (RT) were eligible. Of the 24 patients enrolled, twenty-two patients (92%) had primary unresectable disease and two (8%) had recurrent disease. All patients were treated with definitive intent RT. The team found that the study met its primary endpoint – concurrent treatment with chemoradiation and pembrolizumab improved overall response rate and 6-month recurrence free survival in vulvar cancer.

Randomized phase II study of neoadjuvant (neoadj) anti-PD-1 dostarlimab (D) vs. D + anti-TIM-3 cobolimab (C) in high-risk resectablemelanoma(mel) (NEO-MEL-T): Primary analysis

When:Tuesday, June 3, 2025, 10:57-11:09 am

Who:Meghan Mooradian, MD, Mass General Hospital

What:This late-breaking abstract is embargoed until 7 am on June 3, 2025."
Medicine,"Fluoride has been added to public water systems in the United States since 1945 to strengthen tooth enamel and fight off bacteria, ultimately reducing tooth decay. Mass General Brigham researchers developed a model to estimate dental health outcomes for children if the United States were to ban fluoridation of public water. The new study, published inJAMA Health Forum,found that banning fluoride would substantially increase dental decay and costs particularly for publicly insured and uninsured children.

Simon and the research team focused on children for the study, because fluoride strengthens teeth during development, and more robust data links fluoridated water to oral health in this age group.

The study used detailed oral health and water fluoridation data collected from 8,484 children (ages 0-19, 49% girls) in the nationally representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Using this dataset, the researchers developed a microsimulation model to see how banning fluoride from drinking water would impact oral health, quality of life and dental care costs.

The researchers simulated two scenarios over 5- and 10-year periods, which align with policy planning horizons. First, maintaining current fluoride levels, and second, eliminating the addition of fluoride to public water.

""Using a simulation model to track the progression of diseases in current populations, we estimated the impact of removing fluoride on the risk of tooth decay and the related dental care costs, including treatment for decay and complications from delayed treatment. We ran the simulation 1,000 times to see how different factors could affect the results. This approach helps ensure that our predictions are more reliable and reflective of real-world variability,"" said first author Sung Eun Choi, PhD, assistant professor of Oral Health Policy & Epidemiology at Harvard School of Dental Medicine.

The researchers found that eliminating fluoride increased the total number of decayed teeth by 7.5 percentage points, or 25.4 million more teeth with tooth decay over five years (equivalent to a tooth for one out of every three American children). The number of fluorosis cases-a discoloring of tooth enamel due to excessive fluoride intake-decreased by 0.2 million. They also estimated a cost of $9.8 billion in additional dental care costs over five years, which rose to $19.4 billion after 10 years.

""Most of the increased cost could be attributed to publicly insured children, meaning it would be a direct public health cost,"" said Simon.

The study did not model cognitive effects from fluoride exposure as current levels of fluoride in public water are not associated with worse neurobehavioral outcomes. The researchers note that their model demonstrates meaningful, ongoing benefit from fluoride at safe levels currently recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Toxicity Program, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""We know fluoride works. We're able to show just how much it works for most communities and how much people stand to lose if we get rid of it,"" said Simon."
Medicine,"Today, the World Health Organization (WHO) published its first-ever position paper on immunization products to protect infants against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) – the leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections in children globally.

Every year, RSV causes about 100 000 deaths and over 3.6 million hospitalizations in children under the age of 5 years worldwide. About half of these deaths occur in infants younger than 6 months of age. The vast majority (97%) of RSV deaths in infants occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care, such as oxygen or hydration.

Published in the Weekly Epidemiological Record (WER), the position paper outlines WHO recommendations for two immunization products: a maternal vaccine that can be given to pregnant women in their third trimester to protect their infant and a long-acting monoclonal antibody that can be administered to infants from birth, just before or during the RSV season.

RSV usually causes mild symptoms similar to the common cold, including runny nose, cough and fever. However, it can lead to serious complications – including pneumonia and bronchiolitis – in infants, young children, older adults and those with compromised immune systems or underlying health conditions.

In response to the global burden of severe RSV disease among infants, WHO recommends that all countries introduce either the maternal vaccine, RSVpreF, or the monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab depending on the feasibility of implementation within each country's existing health system, cost-effectiveness and anticipated coverage. Both products were recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) for global implementation in September 2024. In addition, the maternal vaccine received WHO prequalification in March 2025, allowing it to be purchased by UN agencies.

WHO recommends that the maternal vaccine be given to pregnant women during the third trimester of pregnancy, from week 28 onwards, to optimize for the adequate transfer of antibodies to their baby. The vaccine may be given during routine antenatal care, including at one of the 5 WHO-recommended antenatal care visits in the third trimester or any additional medical consultations.

The second WHO-recommended immunization product, nirsevimab, is given as a single injection of monoclonal antibodies that starts protecting babies against RSV within a week of administration and lasts for at least 5 months, which can cover the entire RSV season in countries with RSV seasonality.

WHO recommends that infants receive a single dose of nirsevimab right after birth or before being discharged from a birthing facility. If not administered at birth, the monoclonal antibody can be given during the baby's first health visit. If a country decides to administer the product only during the RSV season rather than year-round, a single dose can also be given to older infants just before entering their first RSV season.

The greatest impact on severe RSV disease will be achieved by administering the monoclonal antibody to infants under 6 months of age. However, there is still a potential benefit among infants up to 12 months of age.

WHO regularly issues updated position papers on vaccines, combinations of vaccines and other immunization products against diseases that have major public health impact. These papers focus primarily on the use of vaccines in large-scale vaccination programmes. The new position paper aims to inform national public health policymakers and immunization programme managers on the use of RSV immunization products in their national programmes, as well as national and international funding agencies."
Medicine,"On World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) today launches a new publication and calls on governments to urgently ban all flavors in tobacco and nicotine products, including cigarettes, pouches, hookahs and e-cigarettes, to protect youth from addiction and disease.

Flavors like menthol, bubble gum and cotton candy are masking the harshness of tobacco and nicotine products turning toxic products into youth-friendly bait. Flavors not only make it harder to quit but have also been linked to serious lung diseases. Cigarettes, which still kill up to half of their users, also come in flavours or can have flavors added to them.

The publication, Flavor accessories in tobacco products enhance attractiveness and appeal, reveals how flavors and accessories like capsule filters and click-on drops are marketed to bypass regulations and hook new users.

Currently:

Countries such as Belgium, Denmark, and Lithuania are taking action, and WHO urges others to follow.

Flavors are a leading reason why young people try tobacco and nicotine products. Paired with flashy packaging and social media-driven marketing, they've increased the appeal of nicotine pouches, heated tobacco, and disposable vapes into addictive and harmful products, which aggressively target young people.

""We are watching a generation get hooked on nicotine through gummy bear-flavored pouches and rainbow-coloured vapes,"" said Dr Rüdiger Krech, WHO Director of Health Promotion. ""This isn't innovation, it's manipulation. And we must stop it.""

WHO reiterates that tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, expose users to cancer-causing chemicals and should be strictly regulated.

The 2025 World No Tobacco Day campaign honours governments, youth activists and civil society leaders pushing back against industry interference. ""Your actions are changing policy and saving lives,"" said Dr Krech.

With around 8 million tobacco-related deaths each year, the time for action is now. Flavors, and the industries that deploy them, have no place in a healthy future."
Medicine,"A new study by investigators from Mass General Brigham showed that a new app they created can help improve the quality of life for caregivers of patients undergoing bone marrow transplant (BMT). The researchers conducted a randomized clinical trial and found that caregivers assigned to use the app showed significantly greater improvements in quality of life, burden, and mood symptoms compared to those who did not have the app. They detailed their findings in a presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting and a paper simultaneously published in theJournal of Clinical Oncology.

Jacobs co-developed the app with Areej El-Jawahri, MD, co-director of the Cancer Outcomes Research and Education Program and director of the Bone Marrow Transplant Survivorship Program at MGH. Together, they created a one-on-one supportive counseling program called BMT-CARE, which they had previously shown can increase caregiver quality of life. But to better scale the strategy, they created a virtual version of the therapy as an app called the BMT-CARE App.

The app offers educational modules, games, and videos grounded in evidence-based psychological techniques that support the caregiver through each stage of the process - before, during, and after the transplant. The trial testing of the app included 125 caregivers, half of whom received the app in addition to the usual supportive care services. The caregivers spent a median of 146.9 minutes using the app. Compared to those who received only standard services, the group using the app had a higher quality of life, lower caregiving burden, and fewer symptoms of depression and PTSD at 60 days after transplant.

""The BMT-CARE App may be an accessible option for much-needed support for overwhelmed caregivers who don't have the time, money or energy to access mental health services,"" said Jacobs.

The researchers are expanding the testing of the BMT-CARE App across multiple centers and with diverse caregiver populations."
Medicine,"The University of Pittsburgh's Natasa Miskov-Zivanov, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering, has received a prestigious Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Award of $581,503 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for her project titled ""Artificial Intelligence-Driven Framework for Efficient and Explainable Immunotherapy Design."" Through her novel approach and the development of an automated system that leverages AI and knowledge graphs to design more effective lymphocytes, she hopes to transform the design of life-saving immunotherapies.

Chimericantigenreceptor (CAR) T cell-based therapies have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, demonstrating the power of synthetic signaling receptors forimmunotherapy. For these therapies, patientT cellsare harvested, engineered with a CAR, and then reintroduced into the patient. However, CAR T cells have been less successful at treating solid tumors. The recognition and infiltration of solid tumors requires new CAR T cell designs.

While researchers continue to explore the most potent configurations, the combinatorial complexity of potential therapeutic lymphocyte designs, including CAR T cells, is vast. Miskov-Zivanov will create a system that will survey the scientific literature and databases to efficiently retrieve and integrate existing expert knowledge with experimental data and recommend more effective CAR T cells and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

Miskov-Zivanov, a computer engineer whose post-doctoral research has been in computational and systems biology, hopes that the automated framework she is developing can reliably accelerate this process. ""As a computer engineer,"" she said, ""I am driven to automate complex design processes. I explore how tasks traditionally performed manually by biologists can be streamlined and executed automatically using computational approaches.""

In 2023, Miskov-Zivanov received an NSF EAGER Award to create a tool that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract information from scientific literature and, with the integration of experimental data, help synthetic biologists engineer new CAR T cells.

Building off that two-year project, she will develop a new system that uses both traditional NLP approaches and more recent large language models (LLM) together with neural networks to read, analyze, and interpret research papers and experimental data and conduct comprehensivein silicoexperiments on a wide range of cell designs.

By developing and testing new prompting methods, Miskov-Zivanov hopes that ""instead of a researcher having to go through tens of thousands of papers, many that are irrelevant, the system can extract meaningful data and insights.""

The extracted information will be presented as knowledge graphs (KGs), which she will further refine and analyze using graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict the most effective therapeutic cell designs. This past year at Pitt, Miskov-Zivanov also introduced a new graduate-level course focused on KGs and the methods for their construction and application. She sees great promise in integrating information and structured knowledge within KGs with data-driven predictions enabled by GNNs, and she aims to uncover novel and meaningful connections and relationships that will significantly advance the engineering of new therapies. Equipping the next generation of engineers with these tools is essential for addressing critical, life-saving research challenges.

Miskov-Zivanov hopes to build ""reliable methodology to engineer and test thousands of designs for immunotherapeutic cells such as TILs and CARs with diverse and potent receptor systems."" Her work seeks to advance immunotherapy while developing new algorithmic processes to identify and present trustworthy, predictive scientific data and research.

""Our department of electrical and computer engineering is so proud of Professor Natasa Miskov-Zivanov and her latest achievement, the NSF CAREER Award,"" said Alan George, Department Chair, R&H Mickle Endowed Chair, and professor of electrical and computer engineering. ""She leads the MeLoDy (Mechanisms and Logic of Dynamics) Laboratory, where her research spans a broad range of cutting-edge topics by leveraging her expertise in digital circuits, synthetic biology, artificial intelligence, and dynamic systems. Natasa's new project promises to significantly advance the field of immunotherapy design. She is an innovator in both the laboratory and the classroom, and I am so excited about her future as a rising star in the field."""
Medicine,"NIH-funded project shows that trans-epidermal water loss could indicate if wounds are fully healed.

A research team funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has identified a diagnostic aid that has the potential to accurately predict the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers that appear to be fully healed. By measuring the skin's barrier function through a process known as trans-epidermal water loss, or TEWL, scientists were able to determine which wounds were more likely to reopen. TEWL measurements are a major factor in burn care, where deep layers of the skin are often damaged. The findings suggest that full restoration of skin barrier function should be incorporated into existing wound treatment standards to ensure complete wound closure and to better identify patients at risk of wound recurrence.

Scientists, working together through the NIDDK Diabetic Foot Consortium, evaluated over 400 study participants who had a diabetic foot ulcer that visually appeared to be closed or healed. They measured TEWL at the site of the foot ulcer and found that 35% of participants with high TEWL (more water loss) reported a wound recurrence by 16 weeks, compared to just 17% for those with low TEWL (less water loss). Participants with higher TEWL were 2.7 times more likely to experience a wound recurrence than participants with low TEWL.

Diabetic foot ulcers are a major complication of diabetes where a break in the skin of the foot is often unnoticed by a patient due to nerve damage, known as neuropathy. They are the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-limb amputations, and untreated or unhealed ulcers significantly increase the risk of death. Wounds that appear to be healed on the surface may not be fully closed below the superficial surface of the skin, hampering the effectiveness of the skin's barrier function to keep in water and keep out pathogens, such as bacteria.

Study results will publish inDiabetes Care, a journal of the American Diabetes Association. The study was funded by NIH/NIDDK grants (U01DK119099, U24DK122927, U01DK119100, U01DK119083, U01DK119094, U01DK119085 and U01DK119102) and carried out by members of NIH's Diabetic Foot Consortium."
Medicine,"Researchers have discovered that, compared to breast cancer that is symptom-detected, patients with breast cancer detected via routine screening mammography are more likely to have improved clinical outcomes, according to a study published today inRadiology: Imaging Cancer, a journal of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

While it is commonly understood that early detection of breast cancer results in better patient outcomes, national cancer registries in the U.S. and Canada don't track the method of cancer detection.

Since improvements in patient outcomes may be incorrectly attributed solely to treatment advances, identifying the association between the method of breast cancer detection and clinical outcomes may have a direct impact on health care policy.

In a retrospective observational analysis, Dr. Seely and colleagues collected data of patients aged 40 years or older who werediagnosed with breast cancerin 2016.

Of the 821 patients included in the study, 50.1% had breast cancer diagnosed as the result of a symptom, rather than as the result of a screening mammogram.

Compared to patients with symptom-detected breast cancer, patients with screening-detected breast cancer had significantly lower odds of an advanced stage of breast cancer, lower odds of undergoing a mastectomy and a lower hazard ratio of death.

Breast cancers detected from symptoms were more frequent in women aged 40 to 49 years and over 75 years of age, 72.9% and 70.4%, respectively. All-cause deaths were also higher among patients who were not undergoing regular screening. Most surprising was how many patients died shortly after their breast cancer was detected, Dr. Seely noted.

""Within only 6.7 years of follow-up, almost 20% of the 821 breast cancer patients had died, half of them from breast cancer,"" Dr. Seely said. ""The patients whose breast cancers were detected because of symptoms had a 63% higher likelihood of dying.""

The researchers concluded that reducing the barriers tobreast cancer screeningin women aged 40 to 74 will improve patient outcomes and reduce the number of patient deaths from cancer. Women over age 75 might also benefit from screening, as these patients were more likely to be diagnosed due to symptoms and required more intensive treatment.

In 2024, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) updated their breast cancer screening guidelines, recommending that women aged 40 to 75 years at average risk undergo breast cancer screening every two years. The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care recommends that women aged 50 to 74 years at average risk undergo breast cancer screening every two to three years.

""The results of this study will likely support the move to reduce the breast cancer screening age to 40 in the U.S. and Canada,"" Dr. Seely said. ""We have lowered the screening age in many provincial and territorial screening programs in Canada and are aiming to establish a single national policy for screening."""
Medicine,"In the realm of colorectal cancer treatments beyond surgery and radiation, one key question gained prominence in recent years: Is the tumor's DNA repair system defective, making it ""microsatellite unstable""? Around 15 to 20 percent of all tumors have this trait, making them likely candidates for successful immunotherapy. So-called immuno-checkpoint inhibitors are often used in these cases to neutralize the tumor's ""protective shield"", which tricks the immune system into perceiving it as harmless tissue. Once this deception is lifted, the body's T-cells can eliminate the tumor.

However, many colorectal cancers remain resistant toimmunotherapyand even to chemotherapy and radiation. The cause lies in the tumor's surrounding environment, explains Prof. Florian Greten, cancer researcher at Georg-Speyer-Haus and Goethe University Frankfurt, and TRR 417 spokesperson: ""Tumors do not grow as foreign bodies within intestinal tissue. Instead, they incorporate 'normal' cells such as fibroblasts, immune cells, and vascular cells. The tumor reprograms these cells and integrates them into a tumor microenvironment, which also closely interacts with gut bacteria and other microorganisms - themicrobiome.""The new Collaborative Research Center TRR 417 ""Cellular Communication in the Stroma of Colorectal Cancer: From Pathophysiology to Clinical Translation"" brings together researchers from medicine, biology, and data sciences at Goethe University Frankfurt, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg, and the University of Freiburg with the aim of continuing the investigation of this tumor microenvironment. Greten explains: ""We are building on the experience we've gained since 2016 through our collaboration in DFG Research Unit 2438 on this topic. In that project, we not only gathered numerous scientific insights but also developed shared standards, models, and technologies."" It is based on this foundation that the researchers will now develop novel therapeutic strategies. ""We want to determine how to deliberately modify the tumor microenvironment and leverage it therapeutically to enhance treatments and make them accessible to immunotherapies - especially for those colorectal cancers that currently respond poorly to existing therapies.""

The DFG will fund TRR 417 for an initial period of four years with around € 17.7 million. The funding may be renewed twice for additional four-year periods."
Medicine,"Accurate monitoring of CD4+T cell counts is vital for evaluating immune health and guiding treatment in people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Yet conventional tools like flow cytometry, while highly effective, are expensive, complex, and ill-suited for widespread use in remote or resource-limited areas. Many portable alternatives remain constrained by low sensitivity, intricate sample handling, or high operational costs. Optical and fluorescence-based systems, though advanced, further compound these issues with their maintenance and equipment needs. Due to these limitations, there is an urgent need for cost-effective, standalone diagnostic platforms that can be deployed directly at the point of care to ensure timely HIV monitoring.In a collaborative effort, researchers from the University of Bath and Nanyang Technological University have developed an integrated microfluidic electrochemical biosensor for detecting CD4+T cells. Their findings (DOI: 10.1038/s41378-025-00893-8), published on April 9, 2025, inMicrosystems & Nanoengineering, showcase a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based chip with gold electrodes that uses impedance-based, label-free sensing. Tailored for low-resource settings, the device enables minimizing handling steps and simplifying sample processing, and delivers results within clinically relevant thresholds. This breakthrough marks an important advance toward enabling real-time HIV diagnostics outside of conventional laboratories.At the core of the device is a microfluidic chip embedded with gold electrodes, which enables both the functionalization and detection processes to occur on-chip. Anti-CD4 antibodies are immobilized via self-assembled monolayers, ensuring specific binding of target cells. The sensor's wide dynamic range captures both immunocompromised and healthy CD4+levels, with a detection limit that can identify advanced immunodeficiency. Compared to traditional bench-top systems, the microfluidic design significantly reduces variation and manual labor, improving reproducibility and making the device well-suited for automation. Specificity tests showed negligible interference from monocytes, neutrophils, and common serum proteins. The sensor can also be paired with a Dean Flow Fractionation chip for upstream cell separation, allowing for a fully modular system that integrates cell isolation, capture, and enumeration-all on a single device.

Looking ahead, this microfluidic biosensor could serve as a transformative tool for HIV management in underserved regions, replacing bulky laboratory instruments with portable, battery-powered alternatives. Its flexible design supports the integration of automated sample processing and multiplexed detection of other immune markers or pathogens. The next development stages will involve integrating the DFF chip for whole blood testing, clinical validation, and refining user interfaces for field deployment. Ultimately, this technology could lead to robust point-of-care platforms that support earlydiagnosis, strengthen treatment monitoring, and advance equitable healthcare delivery in global HIV control efforts."
Medicine,"Children exposed to gestational diabetes in utero with a specific variation of a common gene are at a higher risk of becoming overweight or obese during childhood, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

The study was published today in the journalDiabetes Care.

Scientists have long known that exposure to gestational diabetes is a strong predictor for both childhood obesity and diabetes.

""But it's not infallible,"" said the study's lead author Kylie Harrall, PhD, who did the research while at CU Anschutz but is now an assistant research professor at the University of Florida in Gainesville. ""Some children with in utero exposure to gestational diabetes never develop obesity.""

To understand why, the researchers focused on a receptor gene known as GLP-1R, the same gene activated by the weight loss drugsOzempicand Wegovy. It regulates insulin and appetite.

Previous studies have shown that polymorphisms or common variations of the gene were associated with body mass index (BMI) trajectories across childhood, insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion.

The researchers examined 464 children from the EPOCH study group, a collection of parents and their offspring monitored by researchers to determine the effects of gestational diabetes on the metabolic health of children.

""Our hypothesis was that there were mutations in this receptor that made kids prone to higher BMI,"" said the study's senior author Dana Dabelea, MD, PhD, associate dean of research at the Colorado School of Public Health and director of the Lifecourse Epidemiology of Adiposity & Diabetes Center (LEAD) on the CU Anschutz Medical Campus.

Dabelea and Harrall found that children exposed to gestational diabetes with a polymorphism of the GLP-1R gene gained weight faster and had a higher than average BMI compared to other children.

Harrall agreed and said the study results show that GLP-1R variations help explain why some children exposed to gestational diabetes are more prone to a higher BMI than others.

""This knowledge could help clinicians identify children who are at the highest risk for rapid BMI growth, which would allow for earlier intervention and potentially decrease the risk for childhooddevelopment of type 2 diabetes,"" Harrall said."
Medicine,"Survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) fell during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Black and Hispanic patients experiencing larger decreases in survival, according to a study led by UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers published inResuscitation.

Before the pandemic began in March 2020, OHCA survival rates had been steadily improving due to increased public awareness, faster emergency response times, and broader access to automated external defibrillators (AEDs). In 2019, the average overall survival rate stood at 9.9%, though it was lower in majority Black and Hispanic communities.

But overall survival dropped to 9% in 2020, with larger declines in majority Black and Hispanic communities. Through 2022, those racial/ethnic disparities persisted.

To assess OHCA trends after the pandemic began, Dr. Girotra and his colleagues analyzed data from the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES) - the largest national database tracking out-of-hospital cardiac arrest outcomes, with full data from 30 states and selected communities in 16 additional states. Researchers compared survival rates after cardiac arrest before the pandemic (2015-2019) to each of the years after the start of the pandemic (2020, 2021, and 2022).

""Our expectation was that survival after cardiac arrest had likely bounced back by 2022 to pre-pandemic levels,"" said lead author Eric Hall, M.D., a clinical fellow in the Division of Cardiology at UT Southwestern. ""What we found instead is that it remained 8%-10% lower, which suggests there were still some lingering effects of the pandemic on emergency cardiac care.""

The study cohort included 506,419 OHCA patients served by 1,313 emergency medical service (EMS) agencies. Not only were pre-pandemic survival rates lower in majority Black/Hispanic (7.9%) and integrated (10.7%) communities versus predominantly white communities (11.1%), they also fell more, with Black/Hispanic survival rates decreasing 16.5% in 2020, compared with the drop in white (8.1%) and integrated (6.5%) communities.

""These findings highlight the urgent need to address long-standing racial and ethnic differences in cardiac arrest outcomes,"" Dr. Girotra said. ""Our team is continuing to study how EMS agencies provide OHCA care in their communities to identify and share best practices.""

One factor in the rise of OHCA during the pandemic was an increase in cases related to drug overdoses. The study found that the number of drug-related OHCA cases continued to rise through the end of the study.

""The pandemic phase of COVID-19 may be over, but many of the health impacts remain,"" Dr. Girotra said.

Other UTSW researchers who contributed to the study are James de Lemos, M.D., Professor of Internal Medicine and Chief of the Division of Cardiology; Anezi Uzendu, M.D., Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine in the Division of Cardiology; and Qiang Li, M.Sc., Biostatistical Consultant.

Medicine,"Mass General Brigham researchers are shining a powerful new light into the viral darkness with the development of Luminescence CAscade-based Sensor (LUCAS), a rapid, portable, highly-sensitive diagnostic tool for processing complex biological samples. Compared to its diagnostic predecessors, LUCAS creates 500-fold stronger and 8-fold longer-lasting bioluminescence signals, overcoming longstanding challenges faced by point-of-care diagnostics. Their study published today inNature Biomedical Engineering.

Point-of-care diagnostics have become essential tools in many households, as people measure their blood sugar, take pregnancy tests, and even conduct their own COVID-19 assays. These diagnostics, which allow people to forgo tedious, expensive laboratory testing, are important for disease detection, treatment, and monitoring. Yet current diagnostics can fall short, with faults like inaccuracy and poor sensitivity. Bioluminescence has the potential to alleviate common shortcomings experienced by other methods, like background noise, false positives, photobleaching and phototoxicity.

Bioluminescence utilizes the same natural enzyme that makes fireflies glow to light up biological samples for imaging. The enzyme, luciferase, is added to a sample to find and flag viral particles. Then, luciferin molecules are introduced to that sample, prompting a luciferase reaction that creates a burst of light. But this reaction produces a light signal that is both weak and short-lived.

Shafiee and team developed a unique enzyme signal cascade to strengthen and prolong bioluminescence signals. They introduce another enzyme to the equation, called beta-galactosidase, that sticks to luciferin and releases it continuously, rather than allowing luciferin to float freely in the sample for one-and-done reactions. This extra step means more luciferin, more luciferase reactions, and more bioluminescence. In fact, this step enabled LUCAS to be 515 times more bioluminescent than non-LUCAS systems, and LUCAS signals maintained 96% strength after an hour.

To evaluate LUCAS'efficacy, the team used 177 viral-spiked patient samples and 130 viral-spiked serum samples infected with either SARS-CoV-2, HIV, HBV, or HCV. SARS-CoV-2 patient samples were collected via nasopharyngeal swab, while HIV, HBV, and HCV samples were collected via blood draw. LUCAS provided diagnostic answers within 23 minutes and with an average accuracy across all pathogens of over 94%.

The researchers designed LUCAS to be both portable and easy to use so that it can be an option for high- and low-resource point-of-care environments. As a next step, the team will be testing LUCAS' efficacy in other biological fluids and whether the method can identify more than one pathogen at once. Shafiee also notes thatbiomarkeridentification for many diseases, including Alzheimer's, is a rapidly evolving space-so having a tool like LUCAS ready to go as new biomarkers emerge could prove impactful in years to come.

""We always want to detect infection and disease as early as possible, as that can make all the difference when it comes to care and long-term outcomes,"" said first author Sungwan Kim, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in Shafiee's lab at the Brigham. ""With our focus on developing diagnostic tools that are sensitive, accurate, and accessible, we want to make early detection easier than it has ever been and push personalized care into a new era."""
Medicine,"Salivary glands play an essential role in protecting oral health by secreting saliva to aid in digestion, speech, and immunity. When these glands are irreversibly damaged—by radiotherapy or autoimmune attacks—patients often face chronic discomfort, difficulty eating, and increased risk of infection. Yet recreating salivary function in the lab remains an elusive challenge due to the complexity of the gland's specialized cells and microenvironment. Most existing culture systems rely on animal-derived scaffolds or chemically fixed matrices that fail to sustain human acinar cell identity over time. Due to these limitations, there is a pressing need for bioengineered three-dimensional (3D) environments that support long-term survival and function of salivary gland cells.In a new study (DOI: 10.1038/s41368-025-00368-6) published on May 9, 2025, in theInternational Journal of Oral Science, researchers from McGill University unveiled a next-generation hydrogel that supports the regeneration of salivary gland-like tissue. The team tested three formulations and found that the version containing hyaluronic acid—referred to as AGHA—best supported the formation of large, viable spheroids that mimic native gland architecture. These 3D cell clusters maintained high expression of key salivary proteins and responded dynamically to chemical stimulation, offering a powerful tool for modeling diseases and testing potential therapies for xerostomia.The researchers compared three hydrogel types: a basic alginate-gelatin (AG), a collagen-supplemented version (AGC), and hyaluronic acid-containing AG (AGHA), which incorporates hyaluronic acid. While all demonstrated mechanical properties similar to native tissue, AGHA emerged as the superior scaffold. In AGHA gels, salivary acinar cells formed large spheroids containing more than 100 cells with over 93% viability. These structures maintained metabolic activity and robust expression of functional markers includingAQP5,ZO-1, NKCC1,andα-amylase—all essential for saliva secretion. When stimulated with isoprenaline, the spheroids increased their production of α-amylase-containing granules, confirming their functional responsiveness. The gel's reversibility, achieved through simple ion removal, allowed for non-destructive retrieval of intact spheroids—an essential feature for downstream clinical or experimental use. The hydrogel also successfully supported the expansion of primary human salivary cells for up to 15 days, demonstrating its versatility as a culture platform.

The implications of this hydrogel system extend beyond xerostomia. By enabling the growth of functional salivary tissue in a lab-friendly, reversible matrix, this platform could accelerate the development of disease models, high-throughput drug screening tools, and even implantable grafts. Its compatibility with both immortalized cell lines and primary human cells makes it a versatile foundation for future regenerative applications. Moreover, eliminating animal-derived materials improves reproducibility and clinical relevance. With this innovation, researchers are one step closer to restoring natural salivary function for patients who need it most."
Medicine,"Earlier this year, as President Donald Trump was beginning to reshape the American government, Michael, an emergency room doctor who was born, raised, and trained in the United States, packed up his family and got out.

Michael now works in a small-town hospital in Canada. KFF Health News and NPR granted him anonymity because of fears he might face reprisal from the Trump administration if he returns to the U.S. He said he feels some guilt that he did not stay to resist the Trump agenda but is assured in his decision to leave. Too much of America has simply grown too comfortable with violence and cruelty, he said.

""Part of being a physician is being kind to people who are in their weakest place,"" Michael said. ""And I feel like our country is devolving to really step on people who are weak and vulnerable.""

Michael is among a new wave of doctors who are leaving the United States to escape the Trump administration. In the months since Trump was reelected and returned to the White House, American doctors have shown skyrocketing interest in becoming licensed in Canada, where dozens more than normal have already been cleared to practice, according to Canadian licensing officials and recruiting businesses.

The Medical Council of Canada said in an email statement that the number of American doctors creating accounts on physiciansapply.ca, which is ""typically the first step"" to being licensed in Canada, has increased more than 750% over the past seven months compared with the same time period last year — from 71 applicants to 615. Separately, medical licensing organizations in Canada's most populous provinces reported a rise in Americans either applying for or receiving Canadian licenses, with at least some doctors disclosing they were moving specifically because of Trump.

""The doctors that we are talking to are embarrassed to say they're Americans,"" said John Philpott, CEO of CanAm Physician Recruiting, which recruits doctors into Canada. ""They state that right out of the gate: 'I have to leave this country. It is not what it used to be.'""

Canada, which has universal publicly funded health care, has long been an option for U.S.-trained doctors seeking an alternative to the American health care system. While it was once more difficult for American doctors to practice in Canada due to discrepancies in medical education standards, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations in recent years, and some are expediting licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.

In mere months, the Trump administration has jeopardized the economy with tariffs, ignored court orders and due process, and threatened the sovereignty of U.S. allies, including Canada. The administration has also taken steps that may unnerve doctors specifically, including appointing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead federal health agencies, shifting money away from pandemic preparedness, discouraging gender-affirming care, demonizing fluoride, and supporting deep cuts to Medicaid.

The Trump administration did not provide any comment for this article. When asked to respond to doctors' leaving the U.S. for Canada, White House spokesperson Kush Desai asked whether KFF Health News knew the precise number of doctors and their ""citizenship status,"" then provided no further comment. KFF Health News did not have or provide this information.

Philpott, who founded CanAm Physician Recruiting in the 1990s, said the cross-border movement of American and Canadian doctors has for decades ebbed and flowed in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but that the pull toward Canada has never been as strong as now.

Philpott said CanAm had seen a 65% increase in American doctors looking for Canadian jobs from January to April, and that the company has been contacted by as many as 15 American doctors a day.

Rohini Patel, a CanAm recruiter and doctor, said some consider pay cuts to move quickly.

""They're ready to move to Canada tomorrow,"" she said. ""They are not concerned about what their income is.""

The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario, which handles licensing in Canada's most populous province, said in a statement that it registered 116 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of 2025 — an increase of at least 50% over the prior two quarters. Ontario also received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained doctors in the first quarter of this year, the organization said.

British Columbia, another populous province, saw a surge of licensure applications from U.S.-trained doctors after Election Day, according to an email statement from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia. The statement also said the organization licensed 28 such doctors in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.

Quebec's College of Physicians said applications from U.S.-trained doctors have increased, along with the number of Canadian doctors returning from America to practice within the province, but it did not provide specifics. In a statement, the organization said some applicants were trying to get permitted to practice in Canada ""specifically because of the actual presidential administration.""

Michael, the physician who moved to Canada this year, said he had long been wary of what he described as escalating right-ring political rhetoric and unchecked gun violence in the United States, the latter of which he witnessed firsthand during a decade working in American emergency rooms.

Michael said he began considering the move as Trump was running for reelection in 2020. His breaking point came on Jan. 6, 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters besieged the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the election of Joe Biden as president.

""Civil discourse was falling apart,"" he said. ""I had a conversation with my family about how Biden was going to be a one-term president and we were still headed in a direction of being increasingly radicalized toward the right and an acceptance of vigilantism.""

It then took about a year for Michael to become licensed in Canada, then longer for him to finalize his job and move, he said. While the licensing process was ""not difficult,"" he said, it did require him to obtain certified documents from his medical school and residency program.

""The process wasn't any harder than getting your first license in the United States, which is also very bureaucratic,"" Michael said. ""The difference is, I think most people practicing in the U.S. have got so much administrative fatigue that they don't want to go through that process again.""

Michael said he now receives near-daily emails or texts from American doctors who are seeking advice about moving to Canada.

This desire to leave has also been striking to Hippocratic Adventures, a small business that helps American doctors practice medicine in other countries.

The company was co-founded by Ashwini Bapat, a Yale-educated doctor who moved to Portugal in 2020 in part because she was ""terrified that Trump would win again."" For years, Hippocratic Adventures catered to physicians with wanderlust, guiding them through the bureaucracy of getting licensed in foreign nations or conductingtelemedicinefrom afar, Bapat said.

But after Trump was reelected, customers were no longer seeking grand travels across the globe, Bapat said. Now they were searching for the nearest emergency exit, she said.

""Previously it had been about adventure,"" Bapat said. ""But the biggest spike that we saw, for sure, hands down, was when Trump won reelection in November. And then Inauguration Day. And basically every single day since then.""

At least one Canadian province is actively marketing itself to American doctors.

Doctors Manitoba, which represents physicians in the rural province that struggles with one of Canada's worst doctor shortages, launched a recruiting campaign after the election to capitalize on Trump and the rise of far-right politics in the U.S.

The campaign focuses on Florida and North and South Dakota and advertises ""zero political interference in physician patient relationship"" as a selling point.

Alison Carleton, a family medicine doctor who moved from Iowa to Manitoba in 2017, said she left to escape the daily grind of America's for-profit health care system and because she was appalled that Trump was elected the first time.

Carleton said she now runs a small-town clinic with low stress, less paperwork, and no fear of burying her patients in medical debt.

She dropped her American citizenship last year.

""People I know have said, 'You left just in time,'"" Carleton said. ""I tell people, 'I know. When are you going to move?'""

Medicine,"Researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center have identified a new biomarker, TTF-1, that was predictive of survival outcomes for patients with advancedKRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), following treatment with the KRAS targeted therapy sotorasib.

Results from the study, published today inNature Medicine, found patients with lung tumors that express low TTF-1 levels responded poorly to sotorasib – with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 2.8 months and a median overall survival (OS) of 4.5 months – whereas patients with tumors expressing high TTF-1 levels had a median PFS of 8.1 months and a median OS of 16 months.

KRAS is the most common oncogenic driver in non-squamous NSCLC, found to be mutated in 25% to 30% of patients. Sotorasib is a targeted therapy designed to block the KRAS G12C mutant protein, which is found in roughly 13% of lung adenocarcinomas, the most common type of NSCLC. Sotorasib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2021 based on results from the CodeBreaK 100 trial. It was the first direct KRAS inhibitor to earn regulatory approval.

This study looked at 317biomarker-evaluable patients with previously treated advancedKRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC who had been involved in the CodeBreaK 200 clinical trial and 112 biomarker-evaluable patients treated in the CodeBreaK 100 clinical trial.

In addition, researchers found that the tumor microenvironment – the immune landscape surrounding cancer cells – may also play a role in how well sotorasib works. One subgroup of patients had ""immune cold"" tumors that lacked expression of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1, but they responded better to sotorasib than to chemotherapy. These tumors are typically less likely to respond toimmunotherapy.

""This finding is encouraging because it suggests that even patients who don't respond to immunotherapy might still benefit from sotorasib,"" Skoulidis said. ""It also opens the door to exploring combination treatments, like pairing sotorasib with chemotherapy to improve outcomes for even more patients.""

Researchers also were able to demonstrate that rapid clearance of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) – small fragments of DNA from the tumor found in the blood – following initiation of sotorasib was linked with much better outcomes. Patients with detectableKRAS G12CctDNA during treatment had an increased risk of progression compared to those with ctDNA clearance.

In some patients, ctDNA levels dropped as soon as eight days into treatment, suggesting that a simple blood test could help doctors quickly identify who is benefiting from the therapy.

This work significantly advances precision medicine for patients withKRASG12C-mutant NSCLC. Future studies will focus on further refining response prediction to RAS inhibitors for patients with TTF-1 expressing tumors and on identifying the most promising combination strategies for those with a poor prognosis who lack TTF-1 expression.

Limitations of the study included incomplete biomarker data for some patients, the potential timing of the data analysis, and the ctDNA panel size.

Medicine,"By revealing how fasting muscle proteins signal insulin resistance, this study paves the way for personalized type 2 diabetes treatments based on individual molecular profiles.

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​Study:Personalized molecular signatures of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Image credit: Microgen/Shutterstock.com

A recent study, published in the journalCell, utilized cutting-edge proteomic technology to map the molecular signatures of insulin resistance in patients with diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a rapidly growing metabolic condition worldwide characterized by increased blood glucose levels during fasting or after food consumption.

T2D is also associated with peripheral insulin resistance, which affects the skeletal muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. A recent study documented that over 500 million people live with T2D worldwide.

Genetic and environmental factors influence the heterogeneous pathogenesis of T2D. Subgroup stratification and deep phenotyping enabled the identification of distinct T2D clusters associated with various clinical outcomes.

This finding highlights the need to consider continuous variation in metabolic function when diagnosing and treating patients, as conventional diagnostic categories (such as T2D or normal glucose tolerance) may not fully capture the underlying biology.

Previous studies have shown that skeletal muscle is the primary tissue associated with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and the major site of insulin resistance in T2D.

Improper insulin-stimulated glucose uptake could be due to a post-receptor defect, such as insufficient recruitment of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane and post-translational modifications. It reduces the abundance of signaling molecules or glucose transporters in normal conditions.

A comprehensive system-wide evaluation is required to develop personalized treatments to identify individual insulin signaling variations contributing to T2D heterogeneity.

Although mass spectrometry-based proteomics has been significantly exploited in cancer research, few proteomics-related studies in relevant tissues related to insulin resistance have utilized this strategy.

Identifying the differences in phenotypic traits, proteome and phosphoproteome signatures, and varied responses to environmental stimuli could help determine changes in causative proteins and pathways. This information could enable the development of personalized medicine for T2D.

The current study used proteomics technology and deepin vivophenotyping to map diabetogenic traits based on the skeletal muscle protein landscape of normal and diabetic individuals.

Both men and women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) or T2D were recruited. All participants were paired based on age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status.

Any participant showing high blood pressure (above 160/100 mm Hg), actively using nicotine, diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases (CVD), or being treated with warfarin, insulin, corticosteroids, or lithium was excluded.

Biopsysamples were obtained from thevastus lateralismuscle of the eligible participants before and during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.

This approach enabled the identification of proteomic and phosphoproteomic molecular signatures within individuals in the fasted state and the dynamics of acute insulin signaling.

It is notable that most women in the study were post- or peri-menopausal, which may affect metabolic comparisons.

The validation cohort was sourced from a previously published study to confirm the reproducibility of results.

The discovery cohort comprised 77 participants and was used to determine the molecular landscape of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Of these, 34 participants were diagnosed with T2D, and 43 individuals had NGT.

A validation cohort was designed to validate the findings, which consisted of 34 individuals with T2D and 12 matched participants exhibiting NGT.

All participants in each cohort underwent in vivo glycemic phenotyping, which revealed elevated fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and fasting insulin levels in individuals with T2D. Decreased hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp-derived M-values indicated reduced whole-body insulin sensitivity.

A significant heterogeneity in the insulin sensitivity M-value was observed. Interestingly, some participants with T2D exhibited a higher insulin sensitivity than those with normal glucose tolerance, opposing conventional diagnostic methods and supporting a precision medicine approach.

Experimental findings indicated the importance of skeletal muscle, particularly phospho-signaling, in whole-body insulin sensitivity.

A variation in the proteomic landscape within the diagnosis groups was observed. Stratified proteome-phenotype associations revealed mitochondrial protein content strongly correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity. However, mitochondrial abundance was not a distinct feature of T2D diagnosis, suggesting it reflects insulin sensitivity, not disease status.

Additionally, the study newly implicated protein degradation and turnover pathways, including the proteasome and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, as well as Wnt and adrenergic signaling, as being negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity. This suggests altered protein turnover may contribute to insulin resistance.

In contrast, a higher abundance of glycolytic enzymes was negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity.

The study also emphasized that the ratio of lactate dehydrogenase isoforms (LDHA/LDHB) and the overall stoichiometric relationships between glycolytic and oxidative phosphorylation proteins provided added insight into metabolic variation beyond individual protein abundance.

A total of 118 phosphosites were found to be linked with insulin resistance in the fasted state, compared with 66 phosphosites exclusively in the insulin-stimulated state. Unexpectedly, the study found that fasting-state phosphoproteome signatures were even more predictive of insulin sensitivity than those in the insulin-stimulated state.

The enrichment analysis indicated that the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 family kinases was linked to insulin resistance. Therefore, the JNK-p38 pathway could be a predominant driver of aberrant human skeletal muscle signaling in insulin resistance.

Cellular assays also determined the role of MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2) as an upstream regulator of AMPKγ3 S65, crucial in regulating skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity.

The AMPKγ3 S65 site was uniquely found in humans and strongly correlated with insulin resistance, suggesting it could serve as a human-specific marker or therapeutic target.

The current study demonstrated the complex nature of dysregulated signaling pathways in insulin resistance. Importantly, the researchers found that although there was impairment in certain signaling pathways, other components, such as AKT and some of its downstream substrates, remained functional even in severely insulin-resistant individuals, showing that insulin resistance does not uniformly affect all signaling nodes.

The study observed distinct sex-specific differences in the proteome and phosphoproteome. However, molecular signatures of insulin resistance remained broadly similar between men and women.

While males showed higher expression of glucose metabolism-related proteins, females showed higher expression of lipid metabolism-related proteins. However, differences in kinase activity, such as CAMK2 and mTOR signaling, also emerged. This highlights the relevance of sex as a biological variable.

Despite these differences, insulin resistance-related signaling signatures were largely conserved across sexes.

The authors note that the study's clinical research design identifies associations rather than causative mechanisms. The heterogeneity of type 2 diabetes adds complexity, and the sample, while larger than most, may not fully represent all T2D phenotypes or demographic diversity.

The majority of women were post- or peri-menopausal, and potential confounders such as diet and medication were not exhaustively controlled. Further research, especially regarding the functional role of the AMPKγ3 S65 site, is required.

The current study identified the crucial molecular pathways associated with insulin resistance. The molecular signature of skeletal muscle was strongly linked with clinical markers of insulin sensitivity rather than fasting glucose control.

The proteome and phosphoproteome signatures of skeletal muscle in the fasting state were identified as significant determinants of whole-body insulin sensitivity.

Selective components of insulin signaling, such as AKT substrates, remained active even in insulin-resistant participants. This suggests that insulin resistance does not affect all signaling pathways equally.

The study supports the need to move beyond categorical diagnostic groupings and to instead focus on individualized, mechanistically informed strategies for T2D care.

Future research must consider the heterogeneity in T2D within patients and focus on developing tailored strategies for T2D treatment."
Medicine,"More than three decades ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) as the first immunotherapy against cancer. And it is still used today to treat early-stage bladder cancer.

Now, a team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) and Weill Cornell Medicine is expanding the understanding of how the treatment works - an understanding that could help improve the effectiveness of immunotherapies more broadly.

BCG is a weakened strain of the bacteriumMycobacterium bovis, which is used worldwide as a vaccine against childhood tuberculosis. In the treatment bladder cancer, BCG is used in higher concentrations, and the assumption has long been that it works primarily by infecting local cancer cells thereby drawing the attention of the patient's immune cells to come and attack the tumor - though exactlyhowit works hasn't been entirely clear. Scientists weren't sure the extent to which the immune response that eliminates the cancer is directed against the bacteria versus the tumor.

""It's an example of a therapy that was proven to be clinically effective before we fully understood all the underlying mechanisms,"" says physician-scientist Michael Glickman, MD, acting director of the Marie-Josée Kravis Center for Cancer Immunobiology at MSK and a professor of medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine..

In a new study, published May 29 inCancer Cell, Dr. Glickm0an and his colleagues showed BCG doesn't just work locally in the bladder, but reprograms and amplifies cells in the bone marrow that give rise to a class of immune cells called myeloid cells - boosting the immune system's ability to fight cancer more generally.

""BCG therapy has been one of the most successful immunotherapies for cancer,"" adds Steven Josefowicz, PhD, an associate professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-senior author of the study, along with Dr. Glickman. ""And now it's clear it improves the innate immune system's ability to fight cancer.""

The ""innate"" immune system offers rapid, general defenses against new threats, whereas the ""adaptive"" immune system prepares responses tailored to threats it has previously encountered.

The research combined a sophisticated analysis of blood samples from bladder cancer patients who had been treated with BCG with studies in mouse models of bladder cancer.

The study was led by co-first authors Andrew Daman, PhD, a postdoctoral researcher in the Josefowicz Lab, and Anthony Antonelli, PhD, a postdoc in the Glickman Lab - who initially conceived of and initiated the project as graduate students in the Weill Cornell Medicine Graduate School of Medical Sciences - as well as Gil Redelman-Sidi, MD, an infectious disease specialist at MSK and member of the Glickman Lab.

Scientists have known that BCG, which is injected into the bladder through a catheter, acts locally as animmunotherapyby improving the ability ofT cellsto eliminate cancer cells. But exactly how this was accomplished wasn't entirely clear.

""Medicine's long understanding has been that in order to work as a treatment, BCG has to be in direct contact with the tumor site,"" Dr. Daman says. ""And you can introduce high concentrations of BCG into the bladder in a way that you can't with other types of cancer, and which doesn't require pumping it throughout the whole body, risking toxic side effects.""

The new study maps BCG's broader effects outside the bladder.

Previous research had shown that when given as a vaccine, BCG bacteria raise the body's general defenses against a variety of other infections, including viruses. A recent clinical trial, for example, found the BCG vaccine helped protect nursing home residents against viral respiratory infections.

""So, the question was whether this broader, nonspecific protection that gets stimulated by BCG in the context of infections extends to cancer as well,"" Dr. Antonelli says. ""The scientific understanding had been that BCG was basically confined to the bladder, which is where it was having its effect. But that turns out not to be the full story.""

The team showed that when BCG was administered to mice in their bladders, the bacteria traveled to their bone marrow - and could actually be cultured directly from it.

And it is in the bone marrow, where new immune cells get made, that the bacteria influence the entire body - priming the innate immune system to react to new threats (just as it did for the nursing home residents given BCG vaccinations).

Shifting their attention from mice to bladder cancer patients treated with BCG, the researchers used Progenitor Input Enrichment single cell sequencing (PIE-seq) - a specialized analytical method developed by the Josefowicz Lab - which deeply studies rare circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from a simple blood draw rather than from a bone marrow sample, the way these cells are typically studied. This approach enabled the researchers to understand how BCG treatment affects stem cells, the early development of immune cells, and the mature myeloid cells that they become.

By comparing gene activity before and after BCG treatment, researchers discovered important changes. The study showed that BCG treatment alters the programming of stem cells and early-stage blood cells in the bone marrow. As a result, new immune cells that develop from these reprogrammed cells become better at fighting tumors.

""These findings show that this training of the innate immune system that happens with the BCG vaccine also happens in the context of bladder administration of BCG to treat cancer,"" Dr. Redelman-Sidi says.

The study was made possible by the ongoing collection of blood samples from BCG-treated bladder cancer patients by MSK urologic surgeon Eugene Pietzak, MD, who was a co-author of the study. The research also included patients from McGill University.

Additionally, the scientists demonstrated in mice that when BCG was combined with another type of immunotherapy called checkpoint inhibitor therapy, it was better at shrinking tumors and extending life than either treatment alone.

Checkpoint inhibitors work by releasing the ""brake"" on T cells, allowing the body to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. These T cells, in turn, take instruction from the myeloid cells that the paper shows BCG stimulates, creating a synergy between the two approaches.

Next steps for the research could explore new ways to stimulate this reprogramming, as well as studying whether introducing BCG into the bladder could boost the effectiveness of immunotherapy against other types of cancer.

""Of course, right now that's quite speculative,"" Dr. Glickman notes.

The original studies on BCG were conducted at MSK and launched the modern era of tumor immunology.

In 1959, MSK scientists Lloyd Old, MD, and Donald Clarke, PhD, along with Baruj Benacerraf, MD, of New York University, published a seminal paper inNaturethat showed mice injected with BCG developed resistance to implanted tumors. This was the first direct demonstration that the body's immune defenses can be marshaled against cancer. Today, Dr. Old is considered the ""father of modern tumor immunology.""

MSK has gone on to play a pioneering role in the development of game-changing immunotherapy treatments including CAR T cell therapy, checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and cancer vaccines. And this year, MSK is launching a new, stand-alone Immuno-Oncology research program to accelerate progress in the emerging field.

""Along with being part of a long history of immunotherapy research at MSK, this is a great example of what we mean when we talk about the power of conducting research at an institution where efforts can move quite seamlessly from the clinic to the lab and back,"" Dr. Glickman adds."
Medicine,"In a significant advancement for hand rehabilitation, researchers from Zhengzhou University have introduced a non-hand-worn, load-free VR hand rehabilitation system that could boost therapy development for patients recovering from conditions like stroke and osteoarthritis. The system, developed by a team led by Yanchao Mao, integrates deep learning with ionic hydrogel electrodes to recognize hand gestures based on electromyographic (EMG) signals.

The conventional hand rehabilitation therapy often relies on bulky mechanical gloves that require weight-bearing and increase the strain on a patient's hand. These devices are also complex to operate and often require specialized medical facilities. The newly developed system eliminates the need for such heavy, hand-worn equipment, offering a load-free and flexible rehabilitation solution. Patients can engage in rehabilitation exercises anywhere and anytime, without the burden of wearing cumbersome devices.

The key to this system's innovation lies in its ionic hydrogel electrodes, which are wet-adhesive, self-healing, and conductive. These electrodes, applied directly to the forearm, collect EMG signals generated by hand movements. Deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), then process these signals to recognize a range of hand gestures. In a trial, the system achieved an impressive 97.9% accuracy in recognizing 14 different Jebsen hand rehabilitation gestures. This recognition is linked to a Virtual Reality (VR) platform where patients can interact with virtual environments, enhancing the therapeutic experience through immersive training.

Professor Yanchao Mao, the lead researcher, emphasized the significance of this innovation: ""Our goal is to eliminate the need for cumbersome, mechanical rehabilitation gloves. By integrating deep learning and ionic hydrogel technology, we can provide patients with a more comfortable, accessible, and efficient rehabilitation process. Patients can now perform immersive VR rehabilitation exercises in their homes, without the limitations of specialized equipment or facilities.""

This system has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of life for patients undergoing hand rehabilitation, particularly those with mobility challenges. By offering load-free, immersive, and personalized training, the system offers a home-based VR therapy solution, opening the door for greater flexibility in rehabilitation. Moreover, this deep learning-assisted VR rehabilitation system can potentially be adapted to other areas of physical therapy in the future.

Future directions and applications: looking forward, the team plans to further refine the system's gesture recognition accuracy and expand its capabilities. The system holds promise not only for hand rehabilitation but also for broader applications in fields like stroke recovery, musculoskeletal injuries, and geriatric rehabilitation. The researchers are particularly excited about the home-based application, which could vastly increase access to physical therapy, particularly for individuals in remote areas or with limited mobility. In addition to its clinical applications, the research highlights the emerging role of ionic hydrogels in biomedical technologies, with the potential to create more effective, flexible, and comfortable rehabilitation solutions for a wide range of medical conditions. The development of non-hand-worn interfaces such as this one could become integral in future rehabilitation systems."
Medicine,"From peanut trials to gene editing, new research outlines how doctors could one day prevent allergies before symptoms begin.

Study:Novel approaches to prevent or cure allergic diseases.Image credit: New Africa/Shutterstock.com

A review article published in the journalCurrent Opinionin Immunologyprovides a comprehensive overview of primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches to prevent chronic allergic diseases.

Allergic diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy, are chronic health conditions associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The global prevalence of asthma and atopic dermatitis in children has increased significantly in the past three decades. According to the World Health Organization, asthma alone caused 455,000 deaths worldwide in 2019.

External factors that trigger the onset of allergic conditions include pollution, certain medications, and alterations in gut microbiota. The review also describes how environmental allergens trigger epithelial cells to release alarmins such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), IL-33, and IL-25, which promote type 2inflammationand the production of allergen-specific IgE. The exposure of human cells to environmental allergens triggers the production of pro-inflammatory mediators and stimulation of immune cells, leading to the production of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE).

The cross-linking of allergens with IgE on the surface of immune cells releases histamine and leukotrienes, which promote the allergic response through arteriole dilation, vascular permeability, pruritus, and allergic inflammation.

The current review highlights key primary, secondary, and tertiary approaches to preventing allergic disease. Primary prevention refers to the avoidance of allergen sensitization. Secondary prevention refers to preventing or reducing symptoms in individuals who are already sensitized. Tertiary prevention aims to avoid exacerbations of disease and sustain symptom elimination after treatment discontinuation.

The early introduction of allergenic foods is considered the most effective strategy to prevent food allergic reactions later in life. Existing evidence strongly suggests that the prevalence of food allergies (to peanuts, cow’s milk, sesame, codfish, eggs, or wheat) can be significantly reduced by introducing complementary foods around 6 months and allergenic foods before 11 months. Evidence from the Learning Early About Peanut (LEAP) trial shows an 86% reduction in peanut allergy among children at high risk (those with egg allergy and/or severe eczema) who were introduced to peanuts early.

Other preventive methods developed to reduce the risk of food allergy include dietary avoidance of food allergens, vitamin supplements, fish oil, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and the use of emollients. However, the review notes that current evidence from systematic reviews is very uncertain for these maternal and neonatal-directed interventions, and their preventiveefficacyremains largely unproven.

Additionally, temporary supplementation with cow’s milk formula in the first week of life may increase the risk of cow’s milk allergy.

Allergic asthma prevention approaches primarily focus on preventing IgE sensitization and IgE-mediated effects with respiratory viral infections. Primary prevention using allergenimmunotherapyhas been applied safely in children; however, this therapy has failed to exert allergen-specific effects on new sensitizations.

The anti-IgE monoclonal antibody medication, omalizumab, has shown promising outcomes in reducing the progression of allergic diseases. Omalizumab is currently under investigation in young children aged 2–3 years at high risk (defined as those with recurrent wheezing and IgE sensitization, with atopy in a first-degree relative) through the Preventing Asthma in High-risk Kids (PARK) trial to evaluate its role in delaying or preventing asthma development.

Allergen exposure, minimizing skin inflammation, and fortifying the skin epithelial barrier are the most widely used approaches to preventing atopic dermatitis. Applying emollients to the skin has also been widely studied in atopic dermatitis.

However, most existing evidence indicates that emollients do not benefit eczema prevention in high-risk populations. Major trials, such as the Barrier Enhancement for Eczema Prevention (BEEP) and STOP-AD, have shown no significant reduction in eczema incidence and have noted higher rates of skin infections in the emollient groups. The review further notes that emollient use may increase the risk of food allergy, likely due to transcutaneous transfer of allergens.

In contrast, emollients have been found to increase the risk of skin infections and food allergies, likely due to the transcutaneous transfer of allergens.

Current strategies for preventing atopic dermatitis include eating healthy diets during pregnancy to improve gut microbiota functionality and reduce inflammation, careful use of antibiotics in early life to sustain gut microbiota, exclusive breastfeeding until 4 to 6 months of age, and careful consideration of C-section as it can increase skin allergy risk in those with an atopic family history.

Another promising approach under investigation is the use of gene editing technology, specifically CRISPR, to modify allergy-related genes such as CYP11A1, which is being studied for its potential role in peanut allergy.

Oral immunotherapy, introduced early, has shown promising outcomes in improving tolerance to cow's milk protein and peanuts in sensitized children without triggering serious adverse events.

In one study, 98% of infants with cow’s milk allergy became tolerant after several months of oral immunotherapy, with no serious adverse events reported. Additionally, FDA-approved oral immunotherapy (AR101/Palforzia) for peanut allergy in highly allergic children aged 4–17 years is now available, and other forms such as epicutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy are under investigation.

Allergen immunotherapy is the most effective method of secondary prevention for allergic asthma. Existing evidence suggests that subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapy effectively reduces the development of asthma in patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

A European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) meta-analysis and subsequent studies showed short-term risk reduction of asthma development after completion of allergen immunotherapy.

Secondary prevention approaches in atopic dermatitis mainly focus on protecting the skin barrier. Eliminating skin irritants, such as soaps, detergents, cosmetics, and perfumes, can help protect the skin barrier and reduce sweating, itch, and stress responses.

Some smaller trials suggest partial benefit for emollients in high-risk infants, though overall findings remain inconsistent.

Tertiary prevention approaches aim to reduce the risk of severe, life-threatening allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) in patients with food allergies. The standard strategy is lifelong allergen avoidance, accompanied by the use of an epinephrine autoinjector, which can be challenging to implement correctly and with care.

Allergen immunotherapy, including oral and sublingual immunotherapy, has shown promising outcomes in increasing tolerance levels. However, these therapies are associated with an increased risk of systemic adverse reactions, which opposes the goal of tertiary food allergy prevention.

Treatment with omalizumab has shown promising outcomes in raising the threshold of anaphylactic reactions. A 2024 phase 3 trial demonstrated that 67% of children receiving omalizumab could tolerate 600 mg of peanut protein, compared to only 7% in the placebo group.

Another strategy, known as the “food ladder,” involves introducing baked and progressively less processed forms of allergens such as milk or eggs. This approach has shown promise in safely building tolerance in children with allergies.

Tertiary prevention aims to prevent asthma exacerbations and provide sustained symptom elimination after treatment discontinuation. Allergen immunotherapy with omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab, dupilumab, and tezepelumab has shown promising outcomes in preventing asthma exacerbations.

Real-world studies, such as Real-world Effectiveness in Allergy Immunotherapy and a German cohort of 40,000 patients, have confirmed that allergen immunotherapy significantly reduces exacerbations. These therapies have also been shown to reduce hospitalizations and medication use, as confirmed by real-world studies and large cohort trials.

Tertiary prevention in atopic dermatitis focuses on topical and systemic treatment to prevent flares and disease progression. Topical corticosteroids, including fluticasone, are highly effective in improving and maintaining multiple atopic dermatitis outcomes.

Some allergen immunotherapy and biologic therapies have also shown promising outcomes in reducing disease severity, although long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness remain under investigation.

Biologic treatments, such as dupilumab and omalizumab, have been effective in young patients, substantially improving disease severity.

Experimental therapies include Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, topical probiotics, and extended half-life monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-13, which are currently under clinical investigation. Immunotherapy targeting house dust mite (HDM) has shown efficacy in moderate-to-severe HDM-sensitized atopic dermatitis, with both subcutaneous and sublingual approaches demonstrating clinical benefit.

Current ongoing studies are exploring combinations such as sublingual immunotherapy with omalizumab and Chinese herbal therapy combined with multi-food oral immunotherapy to improve efficacy and safety in allergy management.

The findings of this research highlight the complexity of allergic diseases and the importance of a primary, secondary, and tertiary layered approach as a prevention strategy.

Early allergen introduction, targeted immunotherapy, and biologic treatments, such as omalizumab, show promise in altering disease trajectories.

However, some commonly used methods, such as emollients for eczema prevention, lack consistent evidence and may carry adverse risks.

Continued research into alternative therapies, such as gene editing and combination treatments, may offer new insights for allergy prevention and treatment, though these remain in the early stages of investigation.

Medicine,"A decades-long study reveals that shedding extra weight in midlife, without medication or surgery, could reduce your risk of serious illness and help you live longer.

Study:Weight Loss in Midlife, Chronic Disease Incidence, and All-Cause Mortality During Extended Follow-Up. Image credit: goffkein.pro/Shutterstock.com

A recent paper published in the journalJAMA Network Openexamined the benefits of sustained weight reduction in midlife, going beyond the established reduction in diabetes risk.

Morbid obesity is treated both medically and surgically. Newer drugs, likeglucagon-like peptide one receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and bariatric surgery induce significant weight loss. While these reduce chronic disease and death risks, they carry their risks.

Overweight and obese people cut their risk of diabetes mellitus when they lose weight. The change in the risk of other chronic diseases is still unclear, perhaps because of poor study design and inadequate study periods. For instance, reduced cardiovascular and total mortality after six years of lifestyle modification may only manifest three decades later.

The current study addressed healthy people between 40 and 50 (midlife) who lost weight, as measured by changes in their body mass index (BMI), without pharmacological or surgical interventions. Their risk of chronic disease and/or death was measured over several decades.

The study included 23,149 adults from three cohorts with height and weight measured over 12-35 years. These were the 1985-1988 Whitehall II study (WHII), the 1964-1973 Helsinki Businessmen Study (HBS), and the 2000 Finnish Public Sector study (FPS).

They were classified into four groups: those with a stable BMI at <25 (persistent healthy weight), those with a BMI change from 25 or more to <25 (weight loss), BMI change from <25 to 25 or more (weight gain), and those who had a stable BMI at 25 or more (persistent overweight).

Overall, overweight adults who lost enough weight to become healthy, and kept it off, had a lower risk of chronic disease. This was independent of the change in type 2 diabetes risk. They also had a lower risk of death from all causes compared with those who remained overweight.

In the WHII and HBS cohorts, BMI trajectories remained stable up to ages 66 and 80 respectively. Approximately 5% and 9% of participants, respectively, were classified as obese (BMI ≥30) at one or both early evaluations, indicating a population largely free from morbid obesity at baseline.

Compared to overweight participants, WHII participants who lost or kept within a healthy weight had a 50% lower risk of developing one or more chronic diseases over a median of 23 years of follow-up. After adjusting for the effect of decreased diabetes risk, chronic disease risk remained 40% lower. This may be partly explained by the lower mean blood pressure and total cholesterol levels among those who lost weight.

In the FPS cohort, those who lost weight had a 60% reduction in the risk of chronic disease over a median of 12 years. The HBS participants had a 20% lower risk of death over a median follow-up of 35 years. The median survivor age was 91 years at the end of the study.

Participants who gained weight from a healthy to overweight BMI also had an elevated risk of chronic disease compared to those with persistent healthy weight, though lower than those with persistent overweight.

By choosing cohorts of healthy people with a relatively lower median age, the analysis excluded confounding due to unintentional weight loss. Unintended weight loss is often associated with frailty due to disease, old age, or cancer, so it is usually a marker of increased mortality risk.

Other studies have repeatedly demonstrated a reduced diabetes risk among people who intentionally lose weight, including those who are treated with drugs or surgery. There has not been consistent evidence of marked differences in cardiovascular risk or mortality.

This may be because medical or surgical interventions cause larger weight loss. Again, control groups may be on statins or other drugs that improve cardiovascular risk.

Moreover, healthy but overweight people have a comparable mortality risk with healthy-weight individuals. Above all, follow-up periods that are too short prevent the detection of long-term benefits to health and mortality risk.

These findings may not be generalizable to morbidly obese people, who are usually the subjects of bariatric surgery or weight loss drugs. In such people, weight loss may involve the loss of lean (muscle) mass, which could pose a risk to health over time.

The FPS cohort used self-reported BMI data, which introduces some limitations compared to the measured data used in the other studies. This study did not assess whether weight loss was intentional, though researchers inferred it likely was, based on participant age and health status.

Research in this field should attempt to cover the whole life course, since obesity orbeing overweightin childhood predicts a higher risk of ischemic heart disease unless the weight is normalized during adolescence.

The study did not directly assess whether weight loss was intentional. Still, because participants were free of diagnosed disease and relatively young, the authors infer that the weight loss was likely deliberate and due to lifestyle changes.

The study found that individuals who reduced their weight from overweight to a healthy range during midlife, without medications or surgery, experienced meaningful long-term health benefits. These included a lower risk of developing chronic diseases and, in some cases, a reduced risk of death.

The benefits persisted even when the reduced risk of diabetes was accounted for, suggesting health benefits beyond lowering diabetes risk. Although sustained weight loss through lifestyle changes can be challenging, the findings highlight its potential to improve long-term health outcomes when initiated in midlife significantly.

Medicine,"Most experts and those experiencing the potentially debilitating features of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which affects one in eight women, want greater awareness and a name change to improve care and outcomes.

A new Monash University-led research paper reveals those involved are keen to overcome the misleading implication that it is only an ovarian or gynecological condition.

PCOS carries risks of higher body weight, diabetes, heart disease, fertility issues and pregnancy complications, endometrial cancer, skin and hair changes includingacneand excess facial hair, and psychological features including depression and anxiety, that are all exacerbated by higher weight.

Published in theLancet's eClinicalMedicine, the Monash University-led global initiative involved international online surveys engaging 7708 patients and diverse health professionals from six continents, in 2015 and 2023, alongside face-to-face workshops.

The researchers sought perspectives on awareness of broad clinical features, the name, potential for renaming, advantages and disadvantages of a change, and potential alternative names.

The study demonstrates:

Primary author Professor Helena Teede leads the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI) at Monash University and the NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women's Health in Reproductive Life (CRE-WHiRL). She is also an Endocrinologist at Monash Health.

These organizations are ranked as world leaders in PCOS and Monash Health hosts the only holistic public PCOS service nationally.

""PCOS is the most common endocrine or hormonal condition in reproductive-aged women, yet its name does not reflect the broad range of health impacts,"" Professor Teede said. ""The focus on ovarian cysts, which are not true cysts but rather eggs or follicles that have stopped growing, overlooks the impacts of this multisystem disorder, leading to confusion, missed and delayed diagnosis, and inadequate information provision and care. Research has also been limited to date.""

The NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Women's Health in Reproductive Life (CRE-WHiRL), AE-PCOS (International Androgen Excess and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Society), and UK consumer group Verity are leading this international process to determine and implement a new name. The Australian patient group Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association of Australia (POSAA) is engaged in this process.

""Over eight years, global data from patients and health professionals also showed that PCOS knowledge gaps reduced following the launch and widespread dissemination of two Monash-led International PCOS Guidelines in 2018 and 2023, extensive uptake of information resources across 195 countries and strong involvement of patient advocacy groups globally,"" Professor Teede said. ""This survey data also underpinned the global agreement to move to a new name.""

Dr. Mahnaz Bahri Khomami, the Monash University co-lead on this work, said the current name was perceived as misleading and confusing, with consistent strong support for a name change, and advantages outweighed potential disadvantages. She also highlighted the extensive engagement with broad cultural groups across geographical regions to ensure any changes are culturally appropriate.

""We aim to more accurately frame PCOS beyond a reproductive disorder with a name change that can improve awareness, diagnosis and management without creating diagnostic inconsistency,"" Dr Bahri Khomami said. ""It should also enhance research funding, education and services recognising the broader features of the condition.""

Lorna Berry has PCOS and is working with the international team to rename the condition.

""The aim is to improve understanding for both GPs and people with PCOS, leading to early intervention and early diagnosis and better outcomes for women with PCOS across their lifetime,"" Lorna said.

Lorna said the PCOS community welcomed the change, which was ""a long-overdue shift toward respect, clarity, and meaningful progress"". ""For decades, those of us living with this condition have had to 'fight' for diagnosis, and even after diagnosis, misinformation is abundant,"" she said.

""The term 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome' is misleading, medically outdated, and emotionally invalidating. As a lifelong condition, funding for research is needed, as well as patient-centered care, from a multi-disciplinary team, evolving throughout the lifetime.""

This paper involved experts from the Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation (MCHRI), Monash Health, Verity (PCOS UK), Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand, the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Association of Australia (POSAA), Erasmus University Medical Centre in The Netherlands, the University of Oulu in Finland, the University of New South Wales, and the University of Adelaide."
Medicine,"Young patients with cancer need support when it comes to scholastic performance, which can be an empowering and motivating force during the challenges of cancer treatment, UF Health Cancer Center researchers have found.

The study, presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2025 Annual Meeting, identified four areas of support that need to be integrated into adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer care: help with obtaining school accommodations, support with losing extracurricular activities that play a role in identity formation, navigating a disruption in their academic trajectory including career trajectory, and losing their connection to peers.

People tend to think of school or college as an extra burden during cancer treatment or survivorship care, Fisher said. But AYAs and parents identified how important it is, particularly as AYAs develop independence and a sense of self.

""There's certainly pauses that have to happen depending on treatment plans, but this adds to the idea that parents and AYAs living with cancer want and need supportive care that helps them navigate the stresses that come with an academic or career disruption,"" Fisher said.

Other studies have shown how a cancer diagnosis disrupts AYAs' typical developmental trajectory, potentially creating more mental health risks and financial insecurities long term.

""Supporting their academic needs can help mitigate those negative impacts,"" Fisher said.

To reach their conclusions, the research team compared the lived experiences of three groups: AYAs diagnosed with cancer between ages 15 and 29, parents caring for these patients, and clinicians treating them in an AYA oncology program.

""Incorporating these three different and key stakeholder voices strengthens our research and allows us to better identify what the supportive care needs are,"" Fisher said.

To mobilize resources to support AYAs and parents facing these challenges, Fisher and co-author Raymond Mailhot, M.D., continue to investigate and establish scholastic performance as a meaningful patient-centered metric and functional outcome for cancer survivorship.

Medicine,"Due to the sudden rupture of the aortic wall, aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention, as it can lead to vascular collapse. Individuals with inherited connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, are particularly at risk, often developing the condition at a young age. This highlights the urgent need for effective preventive and therapeutic strategies. However, the molecular mechanisms that drive the onset and progression of aortic dissection remain poorly understood.

In a recent study, an international research team led by the University of Tsukuba created a mouse model that spontaneously develops aortic dissection by introducing a missense variant, originally identified in a patient with familial aortic dissection, into thefibrillin-1 (FBN1)gene. This single nucleotide change results in the production of an abnormal fibrillin-1 protein. The mutant mice showed intimal-medial tears in the ascending aorta, with dissection progressing alongside significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. This ultimately led to fatal rupture.

Histological and gene expression analyses revealed that abnormalities in vascular endothelial cells precede the onset of dissection. These endothelial abnormalities facilitated the accumulation and infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the intima, where the macrophages exhibited both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory phenotypes.

Further investigation indicated that theFBN1missense variant disrupts the binding of fibrillin-1 to transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-binding proteins, leading to reduced TGFβ signaling, a pathway essential for maintaining vascular homeostasis.

These findings suggest that the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and macrophages, along with decreased TGFβ signaling, forms a critical molecular basis for the pathogenesis of aortic dissection. The mouse model developed in this study can serve as a valuable tool for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of aortic dissection and advancing the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Medicine,"Long considered a disease brought to the Americas by European colonizers, leprosy may actually have a much older history on the American continent. Scientists from the Institut Pasteur, the CNRS, and the University of Colorado (USA), in collaboration with various institutions in America and Europe, reveal that a recently identified second species of bacteria responsible for leprosy,Mycobacterium lepromatosis, has been infecting humans in the Americas for at least 1,000 years, several centuries before the Europeans arrived. These findings will be published in the journalScienceon May 29, 2025.

Leprosy is a neglected disease, mainly caused by the bacteriumMycobacterium leprae, affecting thousands of people worldwide: approximately 200,000 new cases of leprosy are reported each year. AlthoughM. lepraeremains the primary cause, this study focused on another species,Mycobacterium lepromatosis, discovered in the United States in 2008 in a Mexican patient, and later in 2016 in red squirrels in the British Isles. Led by scientists from the Laboratory of Microbial Paleogenomics at the Institut Pasteur, also associated with the CNRS, and the University of Colorado, in collaboration with Indigenous communities and over 40 scientists from international institutions including archaeologists, this study analyzed DNA from nearly 800 samples, including ancient human remains (from archaeological excavations) and recent clinical cases presenting symptoms of leprosy. The results confirm thatM. lepromatosiswas already widespread in North and South America long before European colonization and provide insights into the current genetic diversity of pathogenic Mycobacteria.

""This discovery transforms our understanding of the history of leprosy in America,"" said Dr. Maria Lopopolo, the first author of the study and researcher at the Laboratory of Microbial Paleogenomics at the Institut Pasteur. ""It shows that a form of the disease was already endemic among Indigenous populations well before the Europeans arrived.""

The team used advanced genetic techniques to reconstruct the genomes ofM. lepromatosisfrom ancient individuals found in Canada and Argentina. Despite the geographic distance of several thousand kilometers, these ancient strains dating from similar periods (approximately 1,000 years ago) were found to be surprisingly genetically close. Although they belong to two distinct branches in the evolutionary tree of the genusMycobacterium, these branches are genetically closer to each other than to any other known branch. This genetic proximity, combined with their geographical distance, necessarily implies a rapid spread of the pathogen across the continent, likely within just a few centuries.

The scientists also identified several new lineages, including an ancestral branch that despite having diverged from the rest of the known species' diversity over 9,000 years ago, it continues to infect humans today in North America - a discovery suggesting an ancient and long-lasting diversification on the continent, as well as a largely unexplored diversity that likely remains to be found.

Notably, the analyses also suggest that the strains found in red squirrels in the UK in 2016 are part of an American lineage that was introduced to the British Isles in the 19th century, where it subsequently spread. This discovery highlights the recent ability of the pathogen to cross continents, likely through human or commercial exchanges.

The project was conducted in close collaboration with Indigenous communities, which were involved in decisions regarding the use of ancestral remains and the interpretation of results. Ancient DNA and remaining materials were returned when requested, and the generated data was shared via ethical and adaptable platforms designed to allow data sharing that meets the specific expectations of Indigenous communities."
Medicine,"Scientists at the Institut Pasteur and McMaster University have discovered that the evolution of a gene in the bacterium that causes bubonic plague,Yersinia pestis, may have prolonged the duration of two major pandemics. They have demonstrated that modifying the copy number of a specific virulence gene increases the length of infection in affected individuals. It is thought that this genetic change may prompt longer periods of contagiousness in less densely populated environments, in which the time of transmission from one individual to another is inevitably longer. This genetic variation has been observed in strains of each of the two major plague pandemics, hundreds of years before they eventually faded out. The study will be published in the journalScienceon May 29, 2025.

There are three major plague pandemics documented in human history. The first broke out in the Mediterranean basin in the 6th century. The second emerged in the 14th century, reemerging on several occasions in Europe over a period of more than 500 years. The first wave of this second pandemic, known as the ""Black Death,"" remains the deadliest event ever recorded in human history, killing an estimated 30 to 50 per cent of the European population between 1347 and 1352. The third plague pandemic occurred in Asia in 1850. This pandemic spread to and across every continent, and still persists today in ""endemic"" regions, encompassing countries like Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as the United States and Mongolia.

The plague bacillus, orY. pestis, remains highly fatal due to the presence of various factors that drive its virulence, including the gene known aspla, a high copy component in the genome of theY. pestisbacterium. This virulence factor enables the bacterium to travel to the lymph nodes and multiply there before spreading to the rest of the body, causing rapid septicemia.

By studying hundreds of samples from ancient plague victims, the researchers at McMaster University, who specialize in ancient DNA, observed a decrease in the copy number of the geneplain the later stages of both the first and second pandemics. To back up this observation, the Institut Pasteur scientists studied the third plague pandemic, testing living contemporary strains from samples preserved in a collection at the institute.

The National Reference Center for Plague and Yersinioses at the Institut Pasteur houses one of the world's richest collections of modernY. pestisisolates. ""Thanks to our international collaborators who monitor local epidemics of plague worldwide, we were able to find the unique bacterial samples used for this project,"" says Javier Pizarro-Cerdá, co-senior author of the work and director of theYersiniaResearch Unit and of the WHO Collaborating Center for Plague at the Institut Pasteur. ""We identified three samples ofY. pestisfound in Asia in the 1990s in which the total number ofplagenes had decreased,"" says Guillem Mas Fiol, co-lead author of the study and researcher in theYersiniaunit at the Institut Pasteur. ""These three samples enabled us to analyze the biological impact of theseplagene deletionsin vitroandin vivo, thereby corroborating our findings with the paleogenomic observations made by our Canadian colleagues,"" adds Javier Pizarro-Cerdá.

In mice models of bubonic plague, the scientists found that depletion in the copy number of theplagene leads to a 20 per cent decrease in mortality and an increase in the length of infection in affected individuals, meaning the infected rodents lived longer before they died.

The scientists propose that rats infected with these bacteria could spread infection farther in an environment with a reduced mammal population density. The high mortality rate among rodents at the start of pandemic waves drives a decrease in host proximity. ""Diminished virulence may give the bacillus a selective advantage within a reduced population density,"" explains Javier Pizarro-Cerdá. The pandemics eventually faded out, probably due to the reduced virulence of these strains.

This genetic evolution happened randomly and independently in each historical plague pandemic. ""Our research sheds light on an interesting pattern in the evolutionary history of the plague. However, it is important to note that the majority of strains which continue to circulate today in Africa, the Americas, and Asia are highly virulent strains, the ones that were previously responsible for mass mortality,"" says Ravneet Sidhu, co-lead author of the study, and PhD student at the Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University. The deadly effects of infection with the plague bacillus,Y. pestis, are now more controlled thanks to antibiotics and diagnostic methods, which have changed the evolutionary dynamics.

""Today, the plague is a rare disease, but one that remains a public health concern and serves as a model for gaining a broad understanding of how pandemics emerge and become extinct. This example illustrates the balance of virulence a pathogen can adopt in order to spread effectively from one host to another,"" concludes Javier Pizarro-Cerdá."
Medicine,"A decade-long Canadian study reveals that the timing of natural menopause does not affect the risk of hypothyroidism, but women with higher BMI face greater odds.

Study: Associations between age at natural menopause and risk of hypothyroidism among postmenopausal women from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Image Credit: SvetaZi / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journalPLOS One, researchers investigated the association between age at natural menopause (ANM) and the risk of developing overt hypothyroidism among postmenopausal Canadian women.

After following women for 10 years, they found no significant association between ANM and the incidence of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland underproduces hormones that regulate organ function, metabolism, and temperature. Its symptoms include goiter, depression, fatigue, and weight gain. In developed countries, autoimmune causes are the leading contributor to hypothyroidism, which disproportionately affects women, especially with increasing age.

The hormonal interplay between thyroid function and menopause, with both influencing reproductive hormones, has raised interest in how reproductive milestones might impact thyroid health. Menopause, which typically occurs around age 51, leads to a sharp decline in estrogen, which may affect the metabolism of the thyroid hormone.

Notably, 70% of hypothyroidism cases are diagnosed in women over 50, and subclinical hypothyroidism is common during menopausal transition. Early menopause has been linked to an increased risk of autoimmune conditions and thyroid dysfunction. For example, 20–35% of women with premature ovarian failure also have thyroid autoimmunity.

Although some reproductive factors, such as the use of oral contraceptives, menarche, and pregnancy, have been studied to examine how they influence hypothyroidism risk, findings are inconsistent. For example, hypothyroidism shows significant decreases during pregnancy, but sharp increases after childbirth, and associations with the use of oral contraceptives are mixed.

However, this is the first large-scale longitudinal study to examine ANM and overt hypothyroidism (clinically diagnosed), addressing a gap in prior research that focused only on subclinical forms with conflicting outcomes. This could lead to improved guidelines to manage hypothyroidism risk for older women.

Given estrogen's potential role in thyroid regulation, this study aimed to explore whether ANM is associated with the incidence of hypothyroidism in postmenopausal women, using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which collected data across three cycles over a 10-year period, employing a retrospective cohort design.

Researchers excluded participants who had not reached menopause, had surgical or medical menopause, had missing menopause age or relevant hypothyroidism data, were diagnosed with hypothyroidism before menopause, or had ANM <40 or >67 years (aligning with Verschoor & Tamim cutoffs).

Incident hypothyroidism was assessed through self-reported diagnosis and age at diagnosis. The primary outcome was the time to onset of hypothyroidism after menopause. Participants not developing hypothyroidism contributed censored data.

Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics (ethnicity, education), health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity), body mass index (BMI), and reproductive history (age at menarche, use of oral contraceptives and hormone therapy, number of births). Data on these covariates were collected from different CLSA cycles and utilized multiple imputation to address missingness in key variables (e.g., oral contraceptive duration).

Statistical analysis involved survival models, with Cox proportional hazards regression used to estimate associations between ANM and hypothyroidism. Models were adjusted for all relevant covariates and tested interactions between ANM and BMI/HRT (none were significant). Robust standard errors addressed proportional hazards assumption violations detected via log-log plots.

This study analyzed data from 15,330 postmenopausal women over 257,589.7 person-years to assess the association between ANM and the incidence of hypothyroidism. A total of 1,674 women (10.9%) reported hypothyroidism, yielding an incidence rate of 6.5 per 1,000 person-years.

The average baseline age was 60.6 years, and the median age at menopause (ANM) was 50 years. Most participants were White (94.4%) and aged 45–64 (68.5%) at baseline. Approximately 71.1% never used hormone replacement therapy, 52.8% engaged in regular physical activity, and 36.8% had a normal body mass index (BMI).

Survival curves showed no significant difference in the onset of hypothyroidism across ANM groups (log-rank p = 0.7). Multivariable Cox regression analysis also showed no statistically significant association between ANM and hypothyroidism risk.

However, BMI was significantly linked with hypothyroidism: women with a BMI of 25–29 had a 20% increased risk (HR 1.2), and those with a BMI of ≥30 had a 40% increased risk (HR 1.4). The authors note that hypothyroidism may contribute to weight gain (through reduced metabolic rate), suggesting BMI could be a consequence of thyroid dysfunction rather than solely a risk factor.

This large-scale longitudinal study found no link between ANM and overt hypothyroidism incidence. This aligns with one prior subclinical hypothyroidism study but contrasts with others, possibly due to differences in study populations (e.g., inclusion of surgical menopause) or diagnostic criteria.

Higher BMI was consistently associated with increased hypothyroidism risk, though the directionality remains unclear (obesity may be a consequence of thyroid dysfunction). Estrogen’s role in increasing thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) without affecting free T4 in healthy women may explain why ANM showed no association.

The strengths of this study include the large, population-weighted sample and detailed sociodemographic and health data. However, limitations include self-reported diagnoses and BMI, potential misclassification, and underdiagnosis due to symptom overlap with aging. The lack of direct hormone measurements may have reduced diagnostic accuracy. Generalizability is somewhat limited due to cohort-specific exclusions and because most participants were White.

In conclusion, ANM was not associated with hypothyroidism risk, but higher BMI was. Future research should include hormone assays, longitudinal analysis of BMI-thyroid relationships, and explore estrogen’s specific effects on thyroid metabolism."
Medicine,"A new avenue for targeted drug delivery has been proposed by researchers from The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Their findings, published in Materials Today Bio, report the first successful application of metabolic labeling in platelets.

Platelets are anucleate cell fragments that congregate at sites of bleeding andinflammationto clot blood. Their unique properties make them attractive vehicles for targeted drug delivery systems. However, platelets are notoriously difficult to engineer due to their small size and physiologic simplicity.

Instead, researchers turned to a chemical approach, which relies on chemical tags - molecules used to track the activity of other biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, or sugar compounds. Scientists can mix an incubated cell with a sugar compound, wait for the sugar to metabolize, and observe a tag expressed on the cell membrane. This process is known as metabolic glycan labeling and has shown promise in targeted drug delivery systems.

Wang's lab had previously demonstrated successful metabolic labeling in cancer and immune cells. Until now, this labeling was limited to cell types with the kind of DNA machinery that allows rapid cell division. But Wang and his colleagues wondered: Could they tag something without a nucleus? This query inspired their focus on platelets.

Working in stages, the researchers began by testing their methodin vitro, or inside a cell culture medium. After isolating mouse platelets and culturing them with a sugar compound, the group observed chemical tags on the surface of platelets in just a few hours. Their results were validated using a combination of flow cytometry, fluorescent microscopy, and western blotting techniques.

Next they shifted to anin vivomodel, wanting to explore the process in an actual biological system. Injecting mice directly with the sugar compound produced the same outcome, and the combination ofin vivoandin vitroapproaches allowed researchers to visualize and quantify these chemically tagged cell membranes.

Scientists are optimistic that specially tagged platelets can be used as drug-delivery vehicles for cancer, immune diseases, and blood clotting disorders. And because platelets have a short half-life, the cargo attached to them become cleared within days, alleviating concerns over drugs remaining in the body long-term.

Going forward, the Illinois Grainger Engineering researchers will collaborate with outside laboratories to continue work on the drug-delivery side, providing guidance on chemically modifying platelets to accept more cargo and in a more stable manner.

""We have good confidence in how much cargo we can load and how stable they are,"" Wang said. ""In terms of our lab, we are very interested in the metabolic labeling technology. We want to further improve both in vitro and in vivo labeling efficiency, which we think could be useful to many researchers in the field."""
Medicine,"New research finds that self-employed women have fewer risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to non-self-employed women, suggesting that the work environment may play a role in the development of risk factors that can lead to heart attacks.

While the findings also showed some positive associations between health outcomes and self-employment among white men, the researchers found women had the most favorable CVD risk profile associated with being self-employed, possibly because they are more likely than men to experience stress and time demands related to balancing responsibilities across work and home.

Self-employed men of color, by contrast, did not experience the same health benefits.

The study is one of the few to use measures obtained from lab tests and body measures, rather than relying on self-reported measures, to explore the relationship between self-employment and heart disease risk factors, said lead author Dr. Kimberly Narain, assistant professor-in-residence of medicine in the division of general internal medicine and health services research at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. It is also the only study to consider differences across sex and racial/ethnic minority status.

""There is a relationship between self-employment and heart disease risk factors and this relationship seems to be stronger in women relative to men,"" said Narain, who is also director of health services and health optimization research at the Iris-Cantor-UCLA Women's Health Center. ""It is imperative to increase our understanding of how the work environment gets under our skin so we can come up with ways to ensure that everyone has access to a healthy work environment.""

The study will be published in the peer-reviewed journalBMC Public Health.

Prior studies have shown links between the structure of employment and cardiovascular disease risk. Some have found better health outcomes among people in executive positions compared with those in clerical or administrative positions, which are frequently held by women and people of color. Others have found ties between job control and health benefits. For instance, high strain jobs with higher psychological demands and less autonomy have been linked with hypertension and CVD.

But many of those studies were largely dependent on self-reported measures that are not entirely reliable due to factors such as recall bias.

For this study the researchers used data from 19,400 working adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). They analyzed the association between self-employment and CVD risk factors that included elevated cholesterol, hypertension, glucose intolerance, obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, binge drinking, sub-optimal sleep duration and poor mental health. They explored these questions across sex, race and ethnicity, using biologic and physical measures that are more reliable than self-reported measures, in some contexts.

They found a number of negative associations-that is, lower rates of specific CVD risk factors-- between self-employment and health outcomes. These are among the key findings.

Among white women self-employment was linked to:

• 7.4 percentage point decline in obesity

• 7.0 percentage point decline in physical inactivity

• 9.4 percentage point decline in poor sleep duration

Among women of color it was linked to:

• 6.7 percentage point decline in poor diet

• 7.3 percentage point decline in physical inactivity

• 8.1 percentage point decline in poor sleep duration

And among white men, self-employment was associated with:

• 6.5 percentage point decline in poor diet

• 5.7 percentage point decline in hypertension

The researchers did not find the same benefits among self-employed minority men, possibly because they are generally in businesses with high entry barriers and failure rates, and they may also struggle with lower financial capital and less access to mentorship that could better prepare them to maintain a successful business, the researchers write.

Due to the study's cross-sectional nature, the researchers can't make causal claims from their findings. Other study limitations include the possibility that unmeasured characteristics, such as personality traits and coping mechanisms, may affect individuals' choice to be self-employed and their development of CVD risk factors. The researchers also could not distinguish between individuals who chose self-employment and those who were forced into it due to job loss or other circumstances.

Medicine,"New research explores how the Pacific traditions of kava drinking and talanoa storytelling could transform PTSD care, offering hope and healing where Western therapies have fallen short.

Mixed ethnicity kava users seated on fala/ibe (woven mats) and engaging in talanoa in Tāmaki Makaurau, Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand. Reproduced with permission from photographer: Todd M. Henry, 2022.

Nearly 80% of Maori veterans in New Zealand report trauma-related symptoms such as anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but current PTSD and anxiety medications are associated with high addiction risks and offer only short-term relief.

In a recent study published in the journalFrontiers in Psychology, researchers reviewed evidence, including qualitative and pilot data, supporting a culturally grounded alternative for treating PTSD that combines the traditional Pacific drink kava with talanoa. Talanoa is a traditional word used in Fiji and across the Pacific to reflect a process of inclusive, participatory, and transparent dialogue. The study examined whether kava-talanoa can provide safer, longer-lasting therapeutic benefits based on pilot experiences, with a clinical trial planned for 2025. It is important to note that this review is not a systematic review or meta-analysis, but synthesizes published literature, case studies, and experiential evidence.

PTSD is a growing global health concern that affects not only military personnel and first responders but also communities facing climate disasters, pandemics, and long-standing inequality. Common treatments for PTSD include medications and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). However, medications like benzodiazepines often cause addiction, have limited long-term effects, and may not suit older adults or indigenous populations. Moreover, CBT, while helpful, is usually not culturally relevant or accessible to many patients, especially Pacific peoples.

In these communities, mental health care is hindered by systemic racism, poor access to services, and a mismatch between Western treatments and cultural values. These gaps have created an urgent need for safer, more effective, and culturally respectful alternatives. Traditional approaches that promote relaxation, sleep, and meaningful conversation, such as the Pacific practices of kava drinking and talanoa storytelling, may fill this void.

In this review, the research team proposed a novel therapeutic approach that combines kava, a traditional Pacific beverage, with talanoa, a culturally grounded form of dialogue. Kava is derived from the root of the Piper methysticum plant and contains natural compounds called kavalactones, which may interact with the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the brain, similar to anti-anxiety medications, but without the risk of addiction or cognitive impairment. The talanoa component involves open, respectful conversation that promotes emotional sharing and collective understanding.

Clockwise: 1. dried and pounded kava powder is added to the silk mixing bag; 2. water is added to the tanoa or kumete (traditional kava bowl); 3. the kava (in the mixing bag) is washed through the water until the desired concentration is achieved; 4. the kava is served in ipu/bilo (cups made from half-coconut shells). Photographer: Todd M. Henry, 2019.

The proposed kava-talanoa sessions, modeled on documented traditional practices, would reflect the naturalistic use of kava, where participants would sit on woven mats, drink kava from coconut-shell cups, and engage in guided conversations within culturally respectful environments. These sessions aim to foster a sense of safety and community, potentially key to addressing PTSD symptoms such as avoidance, emotional suppression, and sleep problems.

To gather preliminary insights, the researchers collected qualitative data from Pacific veterans, first responders, and civilians who had used kava-talanoa informally to manage their trauma. Reports were drawn from interviews, personal accounts, and therapist observations. They also compared the impact of kava-talanoa with alcohol use.

Anecdotal evidence suggested that kava-talanoa may reduce symptoms of post-traumatic stress among participants, particularly in Pacific populations. This combination therapy provided a culturally familiar and emotionally safe environment for individuals to process trauma. Pilot participants reported improvements in sleep quality, reduced anxiety, and an enhanced ability to engage in therapeutic conversations.

Veterans and first responders who had previously struggled with avoidance behaviors described feeling more comfortable discussing painful experiences during kava-talanoa sessions. They reported a sense of calm and emotional clarity after these gatherings. The long-lasting relaxing effects of kava appeared to facilitate deeper conversations, while talanoa provided a non-judgmental space for storytelling and emotional connection. Unlike alcohol, which often intensified aggression and emotional distress, kava seemed to encourage peaceful reflection and community bonding.

Many participants described finally being able to fall asleep and stay asleep through the night without flashbacks. This restorative sleep was associated with better mood, cognitive functioning, and overall well-being.

The review also highlighted differences between naturalistic kava and commercially extracted forms of kava. Traditional aqueous kava, consumed in communal rituals, appeared to preserve therapeutic compounds and cultural meanings that enhanced its effectiveness. In contrast, chemically processed kava products did not yield comparable benefits in informal settings.

Based on these pilot insights, the team has designed a clinical trial supported by New Zealand’s Health Research Council. The trial, scheduled to begin in mid-2025, will compare traditional kava beverages and capsules to determine the optimal dosage andefficacy, and will assess cultural adaptability across Pacific and non-Pacific participants, with parallel research arms in the United States and Europe.

The review concluded that kava-talanoa is a promising, culturally respectful therapy for PTSD. By blending traditional Pacific practices with modern therapeutic goals, it offers a meaningful alternative to conventional treatments, which come with numerous adverse effects, such as addiction.

Pilot participants described greater emotional relief, improved sleep, and deeper connection through this approach. However, it is important to emphasize that these conclusions are preliminary and based on pilot and anecdotal data. As full clinical validation is pending, these preliminary findings suggest that culturally aligned therapies like kava-talanoa could play a vital role in global mental health care, especially for Pacific and Indigenous communities where Western therapies have fallen short."
Medicine,"General service in the US military may lower, rather than heighten, the risk of depression, despite the relatively high prevalence of the condition among active duty and veteran personnel, finds a large observational study published online inBMJ Military Health.

The potentially protective effects of military service challenge some previous assumptions about its overall effects on mental health, suggest the researchers.

The military environment can foster the development and progression of depression, as a result of the enforced separation from loved ones and support systems and the emotional and physical toll taken by experiences of combat, point out the researchers. But it can also shape personal growth and enhance coping skills, they add.

To explore this further, the researchers looked at the potential associations between military service and the risk of depression, drawing on data from five cycles of the nationally representative US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2011 to 2023.

Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), which scores the frequency of 9 depressive symptoms experienced in the past 2 weeks from 0 to 3, where 3 represents 'nearly every day'.

A total score for all 9 symptoms of 0–4 indicates no depression; 5–9 mild depression; 10–14 moderate depression; and 15 or higher severe depression. A score of at least 10 is considered indicative of clinically significant depressive symptoms.

Among the 25,949 respondents, 2407 had served in the military which, when weighted, corresponds to 8,847,416 people; 23,542 hadn't, corresponding to 89,206,647 people.

In all, 2548 respondents were identified as having depression, weighted to represent 8,852,943 people, while 23,401 didn't, corresponding to 89,201,120 people.

The overall prevalence of depression was nearly 9.5%, and 7.5% among those who had served in the military.

Significant differences were observed, depending on military service and adiagnosisof depression. These included age, sex, race, marital status, education level, income, and the presence of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.

After accounting for potentially influential factors, including non-Hispanic Black ethnicity, marriage, and a high income, military service was associated with a 22% lower risk of depression compared with no time spent in the Armed Forces.

And after further adjustments for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, military service was associated with a 23% lower risk of depression.

Among the 2407 veterans, 213 were diagnosed with depression. The unadjusted prevalence of depression among veterans didn't differ significantly from that of anyone else.

But after accounting for potentially influential factors, female sex and being unmarried or divorced emerged as significant risk factors for depression, while a high income and the absence of high blood pressure were seemingly protective. Active service didn't emerge as a significant risk factor.

This is an observational study, and no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. The researchers acknowledge that they lacked information on veterans' experiences of combat, and that type and length of service, experience of trauma, and serious illness can all influence depression risk.

But they suggest: ""While the prevalence of depression is notably high among both active duty personnel and veterans, this large-sample cross sectional study does not support the conclusion that military service increases the risk of depression.""

They explain: ""Previous research has indicated that the incidence of depressive symptoms among veterans is nearly double that of the general population; however, these studies often involve samples drawn from healthcare systems, which may not accurately represent the broader community.""

They conclude: ""The NHANES database used in this study provides a representative sample of the US population, confirming that military service may, in fact, serve as a protective factor against depression after adjusting for sociodemographic variables."""
Medicine,"A new study published inThe Lancet Child & Adolescent Healthjournal suggests that parental or caregiver intuition may outperform some traditional early warning systems in identifying children at risk of deterioration. The new analysis found that caregiver concern for worsening condition of pediatric patients was strongly associated with critical illness in pediatric patients admitted to the hospital, even after accounting for abnormal vital signs (abnormal heart rate or abnormal respiratory rate).In high-income countries critical illness in children is rare, and often difficult for physicians to distinguish from common minor illness until late in the disease. Delayed recognition of deterioration is one of the most common contributing factors to preventable deaths in hospitalized children, and parents or caregivers are often well positioned to detect early and subtle signs of deterioration, but the relationship between their concerns and patient outcomes is unknown, and many healthcare systems are not currently structured to support their involvement in clinical care.The current study is the first to examine this relationship. It was conducted over 26 months (November 2020 to December 2022) and analyzed 73,845 eligible emergency department presentations of pediatric patients in Australia, with 24,239 having at least one documented response for parent or caregiver concern. The authors assessed caregiver concern by asking the caregiver the question 'Are you worried your child is getting worse?' during routine monitoring. In total, 8,937 (4·7%) respondents out of 189,708 indicated concern for the child's worsening condition.  Compared to patients with caregivers without documented concerns, those with a caregiver reporting concern for clinical deterioration were more likely to experience critical illness requiring admission to ICU (6·9% vs 1·8%) or the need for mechanical ventilation (1·1% vs 0·2%), suggesting that the diagnostic accuracy of the parent's gut feeling outperformed physiological data.The authors say that their results suggest parents and caregivers are a resource that can assist clinicians to monitor for deterioration, and they may perform better than some current systems reliant on vital signs alone. They say this data suggests that parent or caregiver concerns should be proactively sought, and research which incorporates this into hospital systems used to detect deterioration in pediatric patients should be prioritized."
Medicine,"A new study has found that depression is linked to an increased risk of dementia in both mid and later life.

The new research, which is published ineClinicalMedicine,was led by Jacob Brain and Maha Alshahrani from the Institute of Mental Health and School of Medicine at the University of Nottingham, University of Adelaide and the Dementia Centre of Excellence at Curtin University in Australia.

Dementia affects over 57 million people globally. There is currently no cure, so identifying and treating the factors to reduce the risk, such as depression, is an important public health priority.

The potential links between depression and dementia are complex and may include chronicinflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, vascular changes, alterations to neurotrophic factors and neurotransmitter imbalances. Shared genetic and behavioural related changes may also increase the risks.

Previous studies have shown that people with depression are more likely to develop dementia later in life, but there's been a lot of debate aboutwhendepression matters most, whether it's depression that starts in midlife - in your 40s or 50s, or depression that appears later in life - in your 60s or beyond.

This new research brings together all the existing evidence and adds new analysis to examine this timing in more detail.

""Our findings raise the possibility that depression late in life may not just be a risk factor, but it could also be an early warning sign of dementia beginning to develop. By clarifying this timing, our work helps guide future research, treatment, and prevention strategies,"" says Mr. Brain.

The team carried out an umbrella review and meta-analysis. They firstly gathered and reviewed all the best available data from systematic reviews with meta-analyses (a statistical method that combines results from multiple studies to provide a more reliable overall estimate), that had already looked at the link between depression and dementia.

They then went a step further by extracting and re-analysing data from the individual studies within those reviews, plus they added in newer studies that were missed in the earlier work.

Mr. Brain adds: ""We specifically focused on thetimingof when depression was measured, whether it was measured in midlife or in later life, and calculated how much it increased the risk of developing dementia. This essentially allowed us to provide a more accurate and up-to-date picture of how depression at different life stages is linked to dementia risk."""
Medicine,"Around 1 in 7 of US adults who currently smoke may have some degree of disability, suggests the first study of its kind published online in the journalTobacco Control.

And the prevalence of disability and/or some degree of functional difficulty is twice as high among those who continue to puff away as it is among those who have never smoked, the data analysis indicates.

All in all, the figures suggest that 40% of the estimated 25 million adults who currently smoke experience some level of functional difficulty, estimate the researchers.

In 2019, smoking was the third leading risk factor for disability in the United States. But relatively little is known about the prevalence, degree, and type of functional difficulty associated with smoking, say the researchers.

To explore this further, they analyzed data for 150,220 people from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for the period 2019 to 2023 inclusive.

Participants were grouped according to whether they currently, formerly, or had never smoked. And the Washington Group–Short Set (WG-SS) was used to measure the degree of functional difficulty in 6 core areas: vision (even when wearing glasses); hearing (even with a hearing aid); mobility (walking or climbing steps); communication (understanding or being understood); cognition (memory and concentration); self-care (washing and dressing).

Participants were considered to have a disability if they reported having ""a lot of difficulty"" or ""cannot do at all"" in 1 or more of these 6 core areas. Those who reported ""some difficulty"" in at least 1 core area were also included in the estimates.

Between 2019 and 2023, 1 in 7 (14%) of those who currently smoked reported a disability compared with 12.5% of adults who formerly smoked and 7% of those who had never smoked.

The most common disabilities among those who currently, formerly, or never smoked were, respectively, mobility (8%, 8%, and 4%) and cognitive issues (4.5%, 3%, and 2%).

Among adults who currently smoked, more than half (54%) reported ""some"", ""a lot of"", or ""cannot do at all"" for at least 1 disability type. And the prevalence of vision, hearing, mobility and cognitive disabilities among those who currently smoked was double that of those who had never smoked.

The estimates for disability were significantly higher for those who currently smoked than they were among those who had never smoked with the exception of self-care, and they were also significantly higher for adults who formerly smoked with the exception of communication.

Stratification of disability prevalence by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational level among adults who currently smoked showed that it was 16.5% among women and 12% among men and ranged from just over 21.5% among the over 65s to 9% among 25–44 year olds.

Similarly, the prevalence of disability ranged from 19% among non-Hispanic Others to 11% among Hispanics, and from 21.5% among those who didn't graduate from high school to 8% among college graduates.

Overall, the pooled analysis reveals that of the estimated 25 million US adults who are still smoking in the US, about 40% experience at least some level of functional difficulty, estimate the researchers.

This is an observational study, and as such, no firm conclusions can be drawn about cause and effect. It also relied on self report, which may be subject to imperfect recall, and in this case, societal pressures.

But they point out that smoking cessation initiatives frequently don't factor in disability, prompting them to conclude: ""Each disability type may present unique challenges and barriers to using conventional smoking cessation interventions, which can be addressed if considerations relating to universal design are incorporated upfront.""

They add: ""Understanding that more than 1 in 7 adults who smoke live with a disability, and knowing the type, degree of functional difficulties, and demographic characteristics can aid public health officials in designing interventions to reduce smoking that are appropriate and effective for people with disabilities."
Medicine,"Cairns and Townsville residents who want to give up smoking can access free nicotine replacement therapies and potentially life-saving lung cancer screening by participating in a research study.

A University of Queensland-led trial started late last year across areas of southern Queensland to help smokers aged between 50 and 80 who wanted to quit smoking.

Associate Professor Henry Marshall from UQ'sThoracic Research Centresaid more than 120 people had so far participated in the trial, and the project was now expanding to North and Far North Queensland.

The Max Up trial is ongoing and is open to smokers aged between 50 and 80 who register with Quitline.

Dr. Marshall said research from the United States showedcombining smoking cessation and screening reduced the risk ofdying from lung cancerby 38 per cent.

""A CT scan can pick up small, curable lung cancers that are otherwise undetected because they're not causing any symptoms,'' he said.

""It only takes a few minutes and does not require any needles.

""Lung cancer grows silently and secretly, and generally only causes symptoms in an advanced stage, when a cure is difficult so a CT scan finding the cancer earlier gives people the chance for effective treatment.""

Queenslanders who phone Quitline on 13 7848 (13 QUIT) or self-refer throughQuit HQ can join the study to access free nicotine patches, gum or lozenges, as well as a free CT scan of their lungs, if eligible.

Dr Marshall, who is a lung specialist at The Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane, said the study is a precursor to the roll out of a National Lung Cancer Screening Program.

""We want to make sure lung cancer screening reaches the target population and is integrated in the best possible way with support to help people quit smoking,"" he said.

""The trial is called Max Up because we aim to maximise uptake of screening and maximise people's chances of quitting to reap the health benefits of a smoke-free life – it's a double health benefit.""

Dr Marshall saidlung cancer is one of more than 40 diseases and conditions that smoking is known to cause, so quitting has very broad health benefits.

""We know that quitting smoking can take time, effort, and sometimes multiple attempts,"" he said.

""But if you can quit smoking, you get a huge benefit back in terms of life expectancy and quality of life.

""We've got the door open ready for people to keep coming back, engaging with Quitline's programs and counsellors and keep getting free nicotine replacement therapy.""

The Max Up trial is supported by the Medical Research Future Fund, The University of Queensland, Queensland Health, Cancer Council Australia, and Lung Foundation Australia."
Medicine,"As climate change fuels more frequent and severe heat waves, governments worldwide have adopted Heat-Health Action Plans (HHAPs) to prevent illness and death from heat stroke, heart attacks, and other unwanted physical and mental health outcomes. Yet a new study by researchers at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health reveals a critical gap in these plans: while most acknowledge mental health risks, such as heightened anxiety, depression, and suicide, few propose concrete interventions to protect vulnerable populations.

According to one estimate, exposure to heatwaves globally has doubled since the 1980s.

The study, the first to systematically assess mental health inclusion in HHAPs worldwide, analyzed 83 plans across 24 countries. While most (75.9 percent) acknowledged mental health broadly, only 31.3 percent specified heat's unique mental health impacts, like increased psychiatric emergencies or suicide risk. Worryingly, just 21.7 percent of HHAPs analyzed outlined concrete interventions, despite evidence that heat worsens outcomes for people with conditions like depression and schizophrenia while triggering new mental health crises. The findings are published in the journalCurrent Environmental Health Reports(link is external and opens in a new window).

Many HHAPs failed to address underlying drivers like heat-induced displacement, economic stress, or sleep disruption and focused on broad measures like public messaging rather than targeted support. For instance, few addressed at-risk groups like homeless individuals or proposed community-based strategies-such as neighbor check-ins-that could reduce isolation during extreme heat events. Notably, India was alone among low- and middle-income countries in addressing mental health, despite these regions facing disproportionate heat risks.

""People with mental health conditions face compounding barriers during heatwaves,"" explains lead author Allison Stewart-Ruano, a doctoral candidate in environmental health sciences at Columbia Mailman School. Stewart-Ruano emphasizes the need for multi-level interventions, such as ensuring cool sleeping environments or training communities to support vulnerable neighbors. ""Effective plans must bridge clinical and community approaches, combining medical care with social cohesion strategies that reduce isolation during extreme heat events.""

Medicine,"A major new study finds that swapping out refined carbs for whole foods in low-carb diets can significantly reduce inflammation, offering a clear path to better long-term health.

Study:Low Carbohydrate Diet Patterns that Favor High Quality Carbohydrates are Associated with Beneficial Long-term Changes in Biomarkers of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress in the Framingham Offspring Cohort. Image Credit: Tatiana Kosheleva / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journalCurrent Developments in Nutrition, researchers examined associations between varying low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) patterns and changes in oxidative stress andinflammationbiomarkers.

Chronic low-grade inflammation contributes to the development of various diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially in older adults. LCDs have been investigated for their potential to modulate inflammation and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Carbohydrates from diverse sources could differentially impact chronic inflammation.

Food Quality Rule: High-quality carbs were defined as foods with at least 1g fiber per 10g carbs, like apples, broccoli, and oats, unlike sugary cereals or white bread.

High-quality (HQ) carbohydrate diets are characterized by increased consumption of non-starchy vegetables, whole grains, nuts, whole fruits, and legumes, which are associated with lower levels of inflammation biomarkers in circulation. Conversely, low-quality (LQ) carbohydrate diets are characterized by elevated intakes of sugar-sweetened beverages, refined grains, and sweet baked desserts, among others, and promote chronic inflammation through mechanisms like rapid blood sugar spikes (high glycemic impact), reduced fiber content, nutrient loss during refining, and the formation of inflammation-triggering compounds (advanced glycation end-products).

Current evidence from observational studies on the associations between LCD patterns and inflammation biomarkers has been mainly cross-sectional and limited to select biomarkers. Moreover, many of these studies have not examined the quality of carbohydrates. As such, long-term associations between LCD patterns, emphasizing carbohydrate quality, and changes in oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers have not been adequately investigated. The key finding of this new research suggests that carbohydrate quality may be more important than just the quantity of carbohydrates when aiming to reduce inflammation.

What People Actually Ate: Those successfully cutting low-quality carbs ate more veggies and nuts while reducing sweets and sodas, without skimping on berries or whole grains.

The present study examined the long-term relationships between LCD scores (LCDSs) and changes in oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers. Data were used from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) Offspring cohort. The cohort included 2,225 participants, with a median baseline age of 59 (56% female, mean BMI 27.3 kg/m²). Participants underwent standard medical examinations every four years, which included anthropometric, dietary, and laboratory assessments. The study included data from the seventh (1998-2001) and eighth (2005-08) examination cycles, with a median follow-up of 6.7 years.

The food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate dietary intake. Two LCDSs, HQ-LCDS and LQ-LCDS, were developed to assess carbohydrate quality in LCD patterns. HQ-LCDS scored the percent of energy intake from LQ carbohydrates, while LQ-LCDS scored that from HQ carbohydrates. A higher HQ-LCDS implied lower intake of LQ carbohydrates (while retaining high-quality sources and replacing the low-quality carbs with fat and protein), while a higher LQ-LCDS represented lower intake of HQ carbohydrates. The study also considered a Total Low-Carbohydrate Diet Score (T-LCDS), which reflected lower total carbohydrate intake and higher total fat and protein, without initially separating carbohydrate quality. Nine biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation were assessed.

Biomarkers included C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, P-selectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (LPL-A2) activity and mass, osteoprotegerin, tumor necrosis factor receptor II, and urinary isoprostanes. An oxidative stress and inflammation score was estimated as the sum of standardized rank values of individual biomarkers (urinary isoprostanes were excluded from this composite inflammatory score due to a high number of missing observations at baseline). The primary outcome measured the change in this inflammation score over time.

Least-square mean change in the oxidative stress and inflammation score across LCDS quintiles was computed using multivariable linear regression, adjusted for sex, age, energy intake, alcohol intake, body mass index (BMI), menopausal status, smoking status, physical activity, use of corticosteroids and non-steroidanti-inflammatorydrugs, CVD history, and current diabetes, hypertension, or dyslipidemia and treatment for these. Sensitivity analyses, such as adjusting for waist circumference instead of BMI and excluding participants on hyperglycemia medications, generally supported the main findings for HQ-LCDS.

Grain Choices Matter: The healthiest low-carb pattern included 3x more whole grains than refined grains, while the low-quality group did the opposite.

The highest quintiles of both LCDSs included a higher proportion of females, diabetic subjects, tobacco users, and individuals with higher BMI. Total carbohydrate intake was approximately 19% lower in the highest quintiles of both LCDSs compared to the lowest quintiles.

LQ carbohydrates were 17% lower in the highest HQ-LCDS quintile than in the lowest quintile, while HQ carbohydrates were 13% lower in the highest LQ-LCDS quintile than in the lowest quintile. There was an inverse association between HQ-LCDS and the change in oxidative stress and inflammation scores over the follow-up period. That is, oxidative stress and inflammation increased in individuals with the lowest HQ-LCDS (inflammation score change: +0.28) and decreased in those with the highest HQ-LCDS (inflammation score change: -0.31; Ptrend=0.001 after full adjustment). The T-LCDS also showed a significant inverse association with the inflammation and oxidative stress score (Q5 change: -0.32; Ptrend=0.02), similar to, although slightly more modest than, that observed for HQ-LCDS.

LQ-LCDS had no significant association with the change in the oxidative stress and inflammation score. In secondary analyses, HQ-LCDS was inversely associated with changes in LPL-A2 activity (a reduction of approximately 4% in the highest vs. lowest adherence groups; Ptrend=0.001) and ICAM-1 (a reduction of approximately 5%; Ptrend=0.003). Meanwhile, LQ-LCDS was positively associated with changes in LPL-A2 mass (an increase of approximately 3%; Ptrend=0.04) and MCP-1 (an increase of approximately 1%; Ptrend=0.04), suggesting that greater adherence to LQ-LCDS was associated with increased inflammation.

Sugar Reality Check: Low-quality carb lovers consumed over 40% of their carbs from added sugars, mostly in sodas and pastries, while high-quality eaters kept sugars under 10%.

Taken together, the findings showed that LCD patterns that prioritize replacing low-quality carbohydrates (like refined grains and added sugars) with high-quality carbohydrate sources (such as vegetables, whole grains, and legumes) or with healthy sources of fat and protein were associated with favorable changes in the oxidative stress and inflammation score, potentially reducing inflammation biomarkers by an amount equivalent to a 0.31 point decrease on the composite score in high adherers. In particular, HQ-LCDS exhibited a robust inverse association with the change in the oxidative stress and inflammation score, potentially reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Conversely, LQ-LCDS showed no significant association with the change in oxidative stress and inflammation scores. The study highlights that the approach to lowering carbohydrates, specifically by reducing low-quality types while maintaining high-quality ones, is a critical factor when considering low-carbohydrate diets for managing inflammation. This provides an actionable insight: prioritize whole grains, fruits, and vegetables over sugary snacks and refined grains within a low-carbohydrate dietary framework.

The authors acknowledged certain limitations inherent in the study, such as the reliance on self-reported dietary questionnaires and the fact that the study population consisted predominantly of Caucasian American men and women, which may influence the generalizability of the findings to other populations. Furthermore, the study couldn't assess very low-carb diets (e.g., less than 25% of energy from carbohydrates) due to a lack of such eaters in this particular cohort."
Medicine,"A new study led by experts at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, is the first to look at trends over time in alcohol-linked cancer mortality across the United States. The findings, titled ""Escalating Impact of Alcohol-Related Cancer Mortality in the U.S.: A call for action,"" will be presented May 31 at ASCO 2025, the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago.

Earlier this year, the former U.S. surgeon general issued an advisory warning Americans of the strong links between alcohol consumption and increased risk of several types of cancer. Although many of these links have been well known among scientists for years, awareness of this connection among the general public is low.

To understand how alcohol may be fueling rates of cancer-related deaths, researchers at Sylvester delved into data from the Global Burden of Disease database. This public dataset captures detailed disease information from around the world and estimates risk factors – including alcohol consumption – that likely contribute to diagnoses and deaths.

The researchers looked at total cancer deaths, as well as those due to specific cancer types known to be influenced by alcohol consumption: breast, liver, colorectal, throat, voice box, mouth and esophageal cancers. They found that between 1990 and 2021, the total number of alcohol-related cancer deaths nearly doubled in the U.S., rising from just under 12,000 deaths per year to just over 23,000. The burden is especially high in men over 55, who saw their alcohol-linked cancer mortality rise by a bit over 1% every year between 2007 and 2021.

""That's a big and concerning rise,"" said Chinmay Jani, M.D., a Sylvester hematology and oncology fellow who led the study and will present the research findings at ASCO; his abstract has also won an ASCO Merit Award. ""We need to increase awareness of this link among the general population and even in the medical field,"" he said. ""There's a lot of awareness about, for example, tobacco and the risk of cancer. But for alcohol, that awareness isn't there.""

A 2019 survey from the American Institute for Cancer Research found that while 89% of American adults know that tobacco raises the risk of cancer, only 45% know that alcohol does as well. There are about 100,000 new cancer diagnoses related to alcohol every year in the U.S., or around 5% of all cancer cases, according to the surgeon general's report, and around 20,000 deaths due to alcohol-linked cancer. That's significantly higher than the deaths caused by drunk driving every year.

The increase in alcohol-related cancer mortality rate seems to be entirely due to an increase among men. In women, both young and old, the rates have declined slightly since 1990. In men ages 20-54, the mortality rates increased slightly. However, the team also looked at proportions of cancer deaths due to alcohol and found that, even for cancers with declining mortality rates, the proportion due to alcohol for nearly all of them rose between 1990 and 2021, for both men and women. Among all cancers combined, the percentage of cancer deaths likely due to alcohol consumption increased by nearly 50% between 1990 and 2021. That is, even if other factors, such as improved screening and treatment, are driving overall cancer deaths down, alcohol consumption is responsible for a larger percentage of cancer mortality than in the past.

Liver cancer, colorectal cancer and esophageal cancer saw the largest increases in alcohol-related mortality; colorectal and esophageal cancers saw the largest proportional increases. The researchers also looked at trends at the state level: The District of Columbia and Texas had the highest rates of alcohol-linked cancer mortality, while Utah had the lowest. State-level differences could reflect different drinking cultures in different regions, but could also be due to socioeconomic and health access differences, the researchers said.

Besides calling for an increased awareness of the link between alcohol and cancer, Jani said it will be important to further tease out the biology behind this connection. Alcohol is known to increase cancer risk through several different mechanisms, including DNA damage and altering levels of hormones. Biological differences among people may impact how alcohol consumption raises their individual risk, and further understanding these differences could eventually allow physicians to screen for patients at highest risk and tailor counseling individually."
Medicine,"A new four-drug combination is highly effective and safe in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, according to data presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, held May 30 through June 3 in Chicago.

The data emerged from the ADVANCE clinical trial led by Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, part of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

The randomized, multi-center trial tests the effects of adding the targeted drug daratumumab to the standard three-part therapy regimen, called KRd (carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone).

""This study shows that daratumumab added to KRd is a new standard of care for those patients who had previously been candidates for just KRd,"" said Sylvester Myeloma Institute Director and study head C. Ola Landgren, M.D., Ph.D., who will present the findings June 3.

The new clinical trial has its roots in the MANHATTAN trial, a smaller trial also led by Landgren. In that trial, newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients were also treated with daratumumab added to KRd, a combination called DKRd.

The results of the MANHATTAN trial were ""spectacular,"" said Landgren. Sensitive methods to assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) showed that 71% of patients had no detectable disease after completing their treatment. That trial, however, was a single-arm study - all 41 patients received DKRd.

The ADVANCE trial goes further by directly comparing KRd to DKRd in a large, multi-center, randomized (1:1) clinical trial in the U.S.

Half of the 306 patients in the ADVANCE trial were randomly assigned to treatment with KRd and half to DKRd.

The new results show that 59% of DKRd-treated patients were MRD-negative after eight cycles of treatment compared with 36% of KRd-treated patients.

The longer-term durability of the response is an open question. However, the data so far are encouraging: at 32.7 months of follow-up, 86% of patients on DKRd showed progression-free survival, compared to 79% of patients on KRd.

Adding daratumumab to KRd did not add any significant toxicities, added Landgren - in part because of exclusion of patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients who were frail. Prior to study enrollment, all patients were screened and cleared by standard labs, a standard clinical exam, and EKG and cardiac ECHO, per the study protocol.

""If you give it to the right patients, in the right way, it is an extremely safe and very effective therapy,"" said Landgren.

The new four-drug drug combination leverages a range of therapeutic targets and modalities. Carfilzomib (brand name Kyprolis) inhibits the protein-degrading machinery in cells, and Lenalidomide (Revlimid and other brand names) stimulates immune activity against tumors, among other actions. Dexamethasone has effects on immunity andinflammation.

These three drugs may shrink tumors enough to enable daratumumab to finish the job, said Landgren. Daratumumab targets the CD38 protein on multiple myeloma cells and induces tumor cell death.

Tumors from patients in the trial are undergoing detailed molecular scrutiny. Questions include why tumors respond differently to the drug regimens, and why some develop resistance.

Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients at Sylvester and other cancer centers are already routinely receiving the four-drug DKRd combination.

""It has definitely changed my practice,"" said Sylvester physician Dickran Kazandjian, M.D., lead co-PI on the ADVANCE study. ""Your best shot at getting your best response is with the first treatment.""

Landgren's research has changed clinical practice before. His studies helped lead to the adoption of carfilzomib as a less toxic substitute for bortezomib.

He and his team may change clinical practice yet again. They are planning a new multiple myeloma trial that will test several drugs in combination with a bispecificT cellengager, a newer type ofimmunotherapytreatment.

The ADVANCE trial also showcases a trend in which an increasing number of patients are forgoing up-front transplantation as a consequence of achieving MRD negativity with modern, effective combination therapy alone.

Eligible patients in the study had stem cells collected after four cycles, in case they need a transplant after completing treatment. But the patients who achieved MRD-negative status kept their stem cells in the -80°C freezer and deferred their transplant. Instead, they moved straight to lenalidomide maintenance therapy, per the study protocol.

Landgren and Kazandjian credit the Sylvester clinical trial team for bringing the ADVANCE study to Sylvester locations throughout south Florida. Other institutions involved in the ADVANCE trial are MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Moffitt Cancer Center, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Huntsman Cancer Foundation and Stony Brook Cancer Center.

The National Cancer Institute estimates that 36,110 people in 2025 will be newly affected by multiple myeloma, the second most common blood cancer."
Medicine,"As breast cancer deaths linked to red meat surge in younger women, especially in developing nations, research explains why changing what’s on your plate could save lives.

Study:Global, regional, and national analyses of the burden among adult women of breast cancer attributable to diet high in red meat from 1990 to 2021: longitudinal observational study. Image Credit: Explode / Shutterstock

In a recent study in the journalFrontiers in Public Health, researchers investigated temporal, geographic, and socio-demographic trends and risk associations in female breast cancer worldwide. Specifically, the study leveraged more than 30 years of data (1990–2021) from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study to quantify the impacts of high unprocessed red meat consumption on regional, national, and global breast cancer–associated mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs).

Study findings indicated significant increases in unprocessed red meat-associated model-estimated numbers of mortality (from 44,492 in 1990 to 79,956 in 2021, a 79.7% rise) and model-estimated DALYs (from 1,379,721 to 2,407,092, a 74.5% rise) between 1990 and 2021, with low- and middle socio-demographic index (SDI) regions experiencing particularly pronounced impacts, although the patterns varied. For instance, age-standardized rates (ASR) of mortality and DALYs declined in high SDI regions, while low-middle SDI regions saw significant increases in these age-standardized rates. Low SDI regions, despite lower absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs, experienced sharp relative increases in these absolute figures. These findings detail the ongoing increases in global breast cancer burden among adult women (ages 25–45 yrs), highlighting the demerits of healthcare disparities and Western dietary patterns and emphasizing the need for targeted healthcare and nutritional interventions to mitigate breast cancer in the future.

Global meat consumption has been rising at unprecedented rates, almost doubling since 1961, with developing nations (e.g., China) demonstrating the highest increases. Unfortunately, a growing body of literature suggests that high red meat consumption (RMC) has a detrimental impact on human health, particularly concerning cancer incidence and progression.

Consequently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified unprocessed red meat as “probably carcinogenic to humans” (Group 2A carcinogen, 2015). Unfortunately, studies explicitly investigating the associations between RMC and subsequent cancer risk have produced inconsistent and confounding results, triggering a global debate on the safety of RMC. Notably, a comprehensive analysis of the burden of breast cancer in adult women attributable to high unprocessed red meat consumption, using the latest GBD 2021 data and examining temporal trends across various SDI levels, had not been undertaken until this study.

Breast cancer is a leading global cause of female morbidity and mortality, accounting for 670,000 deaths in 2022 alone. While public health interventions have gradually curbed mortality rates in developed nations, predictive models suggest that the overall global burden of breast cancer will exacerbate in the coming years, emphasizing the need for improved medical understanding of factors (particularly modifiable) contributing to disease risk.

Impact of red meat consumption on DALYs and deaths across regions and SDI levels.(A)Proportion of breast cancer DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) is attributed to diets high in red meat across different global regions.(B)Proportion of breast cancer deaths attributed to diets high in red meat across different global regions.(C)Proportion of breast cancer DALYs attributed to diets high in red meat across various Sociodemographic Index (SDI) levels.(D)Proportion of breast cancer deaths attributed to diets high in red meat across various Sociodemographic Index (SDI) levels.

The present study aims to estimate the impacts of high unprocessed RMC on breast cancer-associated adult female deaths, age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR) across regional, national, and global scales. It aims to inform women, clinicians, and public health agencies about behavioral and dietary modifications (actionable strategies) that can help mitigate breast cancer risk, ultimately leading to a safer and healthier tomorrow. The study methodology and analyses adhere to the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) guidelines.

Study data were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study, a comprehensive database that combines records from 204 countries between 1990 and 2021, tracking disease burden over time. Specifically, researchers extracted data on gender (female), age (25–45 years), region, socio-demographic index (SDI), exposure (high unprocessed RMC defined as >23 grams/day), and outcomes (deaths and DALYs; the study did not focus on breast cancer incidence or prevalence as primary reported outcomes). They used these to compute ASMR, DALYs, and ASDR. In the GBD framework, DALYs are calculated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD).

Statistical models (linear regressions) were used to evaluate temporal trends in unprocessed RMC-associated breast cancer metrics via an ‘estimated annual percentage change (EAPC)’ metric. To ensure the robustness, generalizability, and reproducibility of the results, all models were adjusted for potential confounders (e.g., stratified by age), SDI (low, low-middle, middle, high-middle, and high), and regions (using hierarchical cluster analysis), and were expressed in per 100,000 people metrics.

Study findings revealed a stark surge in global unprocessed RMC-associated female breast cancer burden between 1990 and 2021. Breast cancer-related model-estimated numbers of mortality increased from 44,492 to 79,956 (an approximate 79.7% rise), while model-estimated DALYs increased from 1,379,721 to 2,407,092 (an approximate 74.5% rise).

EAPC analyses, however, highlighted that trends in age-standardized rates (ASR) were significantly varied across SDIs and regions. It is important to distinguish between changes in absolute numbers and changes in these age-standardized rates. High SDI regions demonstrated reductions in ASMR (an EAPC of -1.47%) and ASDRs (an EAPC of -1.48%). In contrast, low-middle SDI regions experienced substantial increases in these age-standardized rates (EAPC for ASMR: 1.39%; ASDR: 1.42%). High-middle SDI regions also showed significant increases in the absolute number of deaths and DALYs, though their age-standardized rates (EAPC) declined. Low SDI regions, despite lower absolute numbers of deaths and DALYs, experienced sharp relative increases in these absolute figures. The study also reported a nonlinear, ""S""-shaped association between overall ASMR/ASDR and SDI at regional and national levels, with the burden typically peaking in moderate SDI regions.

At the country level, China demonstrated a sharp rise in the absolute number of breast cancer deaths attributed to high unprocessed red meat consumption, from the GBD 2021 study's reported model-estimated 44.98 deaths for China in 1990 to model-estimated 125.86 deaths for China in 2021 (these are absolute model-based estimates specific to China, not rates per 100,000 or regional totals for East Asia), reflecting its substantially increased RMC during the last 30 years. In absolute numbers of deaths in 2021, India reported over 190 deaths. From the perspective of age-standardized DALY rates (ASDR), smaller island nations such as American Samoa (167.25 per 100,000), Nauru (161.33 per 100,000), and Palau (161.32 per 100,000) exhibited especially high breast cancer burdens. In contrast, Western Europe presented declines in ASDR between 1990 and 2021.

Age-stratified risk assessment identified women in the 40–44 years cohort as the most vulnerable, demonstrating increased mortality and DALYs across all investigated regions and SDIs.

The present study provides evidence quantifying the significant and growing population-level burden of breast cancer attributable to high unprocessed red meat consumption, reinforcing its observed association with breast cancer development on a population scale rather than implying direct individual causality. It highlights high-risk populations (SDI and age), regional healthcare disparities, and temporal trends in breast cancer morbidity and mortality, underscoring the urgent need for region-specific tailored dietary interventions to mitigate the projected rise in the disease’s burden. The paper also notes limitations, including data gaps in certain regions and the consideration of only a few behavioral and metabolic risks."
Medicine,"RTX is a non-addictive pain therapy derived from a cactus-like plant.

National Institute of Health (NIH) scientists report that a first-in-human clinical trial of a new therapy based on the plant-derived molecule resiniferatoxin (RTX) shows that it is a safe and effective agent for pain control in patients with intractable cancer pain. Researchers tested a single injection of small quantities of RTX into the lumbar cerebral spinal fluid (by lumbar puncture) of advanced-stage cancer patients and found that it reduced their reported worst pain intensity by 38% and their use of pain-relieving opioids by 57%.

The trial enrolled research participants with terminal end-stage cancer who were among the 15% of cancer patients unable to find pain relief from standard of care pain interventions, including vast quantity of opiates without relief.

A single injection of RTX provided patients durable relief. Patients' need for pain-relieving opioids declined sharply, and their quality of life improved. They no longer needed to spend significant periods being sedated with opioids and after treatment were able to reengage with their family, friends and communities.

The NIH scientists believe RTX has potential to treat many other pain conditions, including other types of cancer pain,chronic painfrom nerve injuries called neuromas, post-surgical pain, a facial pain condition called trigeminal neuralgia, and chronic oral inflammatory problems following head and neck radiation therapy.

""Targeting specific nerves brings many pain disorders into range of RTX and allows physicians to tailor the treatment to the patient's pain problem. This interventional approach is a simple path to personalized pain medicine,"" said senior study author Michael Iadarola, PhD, a senior research scientist in the NIH Clinical Center Department of Perioperative Medicine.

RTX is not addictive and doesn't cause a high. Instead, it prevents pain signals from reaching the brain by inactivating a specific sub-group of nerve fibers which transmit heat and pain signals from damaged tissue. RTX is an activator of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, or  TRPV1 ion channel and a super-potent equivalent of capsaicin, the active molecule in hot peppers. The ability of RTX to open the channel pore in TRPV1 allows an overload of calcium to flood into the nerve fiber and block its ability to transmit pain signals.

""Basically, RTX cuts the pain-specific wires connecting the body to the spinal cord, but leaves many other sensations are intact,"" Iadarola said. ""These TRPV1 neurons are really the most important population of neurons that you want to target for effective pain relief.""

Iadarola's contributions have led decades of basic science research into the neurobiology of pain and pain control. That body of research has informed them that to effectively block pain, you must block it from getting into the spinal cord and from there having it leave the spinal cord to transit to the brain, where we perceive pain.

Unlike other current approaches that use heat, cold, chemicals, or surgery to non-selectively interrupt nerves to stop pain, RTX targets the specific sensory pathways of tissue damage pain and heat. Other sensory pathways, such as touch, pin prick, pressure, muscle position sense (known as proprioception), and motor function, remain intact. It is not a generalized numbing as occurs with local anesthetics.

""What makes this unique from all the other things that are out there is this is so highly selective,"" Mannes said. ""The only thing it seems to take out is heat sensation and pain.""

RTX is derived from theEuphorbia resiniferaplant, a cactus-like plant native to North Africa. Euphorbia extract has been known for 2,000 years to contain an ""irritant"" substance, which NIH scientists identified how to use for patients through basic research on living cells observed through a microscope. Adding RTX to TRPV1-containing cells caused a visible calcium overload, which Iadarola and Mannes eventually translated into an early-stage human clinical trial.

The next steps include additional, larger clinical trials to move RTX toward eventual approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and clinical availability.

This research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the NIH Clinical Center and NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke."
Medicine,"Immediate recovery efforts receive the most attention after severe natural disasters, yet new data from researchers at Drexel University and the University of Maryland suggests these climate events often also leave a critical long-term - and often unaddressed - problem in declines in access to health care.

The team found a statistically significant link between severe natural disasters, such as heatwaves, droughts, floods and wildfires, and loss of health care infrastructure - including hospitals and outpatient care facilities.

Data was drawn from 3,108 United States counties nationwide from 2000-2014. It included whether a county never had, lost, gained, or always had a health care facility, and a record of 6,263 climate disasters those counties experienced during that period. After adjusting for other factors that could impact closures, such as total population and poverty, the team found an even stronger association between severe climate events and closures of outpatient care practices. The findings were recently published in theInternational Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health.County-level disaster data came from the Spatial Hazards and Events Losses database. Using data on losses, the researchers classified each disaster's impact as ""minor"" (causing a death or less than $10 in property damage per capita), ""moderate"" (causing two deaths or $10-50 in damage per capita), or ""major"" (causing three or more deaths or more than $50 in property damage per capita). Health care infrastructure data came from the National Establishment Time Series database.

Unlike previous studies that typically focused on a single disaster in a single location, such as Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Sandy, the currently study captured all climate-related disaster events nationwide during the time period.

By 2050, the effects of climate change across the globe are predicted to cause 14.5 million deaths, as well as $12.5 trillion in economic costs (including $1.1 trillion faced by health care systems), according to a 2024 World Economic Forum report.

""Our study offers another key data point to support investment in public health infrastructure, as well as disaster planning and recovery efforts,"" said lead author Kevin Chang, MD, who contributed to the research as a medical student in Drexel's College of Medicine. ""Without these investments, more patients will experience an interruption in care and worse health post-disaster.""

The team found no link between closures of pharmacies and climate disasters, and suspect that this is due to the wide prevalence of ""pharmacy deserts,"" communities that lack access to a pharmacy - created by the expanded role of pharmacy benefit managers and use of online pharmacies across the United States. The study did not examine other types of medical facilities, such as community health centers, urgent care, and long-term care practices.

The team's study also showed that counties that lost health care facilities were more likely to experience high poverty and greater racial segregation. Similarly, counties that maintained or gained health care facilities following a natural disaster had lower levels of poverty.

""More affluent communities often have better connections, such as political influence, that help them maintain these important health institutions following a period of crisis,"" said Michael. ""These collaborations after a natural disaster are especially critical in low-income communities that often otherwise lack the resources to rebuild shuttered health institutions.""

The authors suggest that these findings may be conservative, considering the increasing number of climate-induced natural disasters and costs associated with these events. Future studies, the authors suggest, should seek out what influences this link between climate disasters and loss of health care infrastructure, including policy, funding and measures of community resilience."
Medicine,"A dysfunction in muscle blood vessels could be to blame for the weak muscles and weight loss that most cancer patients experience, according to a new study from University of Illinois Chicago researchers.

The discovery may help cancer survivors regain their muscle strength, which could contribute to better outcomes for these patients, said Dr. Jalees Rehman, senior author of the new paper and the Benjamin J. Goldberg Professor and head of the department of biochemistry and molecular genetics at the College of Medicine.

Up to 80% of patients with cancer experience muscle wasting, known as cachexia, a debilitating complication marked by extreme fatigue, weight loss and lack of appetite.

""It is one of the major determinants of poor outcomes in cancer survivors, if they're unable to engage in their activities of daily living because they've lost a lot of their muscle strength,"" said Rehman, who is also co-leader of the Translational Oncology Research Program at the University of Illinois Cancer Center.

As cancer progresses, a tumor molecule circulating in the bloodstream can flip a ""molecular switch"" in muscle blood vessel cells and cause them to malfunction, according to the study published inNature Cancer.However, blood vessel health can be restored by turning ""on"" this molecular switch, thereby reversing the muscle wasting.

There's no FDA-approved treatment for cachexia, and common treatment plans focusing on nutrition and exercise don't seem to suffice, Rehman said. Past studies of cachexia focused on how an immune response leading toinflammationin the muscle might cause the condition.

Blood vessels are the highways in the body, bringing nutrients and oxygen to organs, including the muscles. But they also contribute to essential organ function and health. ""They are more than just passive conduits; they help instruct our organs and tissues,"" Rehman said.

The researchers used an animal model of pancreatic cancer to compare the blood vessels in sick, cachexic muscles and healthy muscles. With high-resolution 3D microscopy, they showed that cachexic muscles have fewer blood vessels than healthy muscles.

They also found that these muscles had less mass and thinner fibers and couldn't perform as well on tests of strength. The same was true when they looked at models of other cancers, including colon cancer, lung cancer and skinmelanoma, and when they tested muscle samples from cancer patients.

Next, the researchers analyzed the genes in cells lining the muscles' blood vessels, known as endothelial cells. The endothelial cells of cachexic muscles were more aged, leaky and prone to dying than those in healthy muscles, said Kim.

""The more vascular dysfunction there is, the more the muscle seems to suffer,"" Rehman said.

They found that a molecule called activin A was more prevalent in the endothelial cells with cancer cachexia than in healthy ones. This increased activin A suppressed the expression of an important protein called PGC1α,"" Rehman said. The researchers found that switching PGC1α back ""on"" restored blood vessel health and subsequently improved muscle strength.

Rehman and his colleagues are working on therapies that can target PGC1α and activin A as treatments for cachexia in cancer.

Medicine,"Researchers gave participants face tattoos that can track when their brain is working too hard. Published May 29 in the Cell Press journalDevice, the study introduces a non-permanent wireless forehead e-tattoo that decodes brainwaves to measure mental strain without bulky headgear. This technology may help track the mental workload of workers like air traffic controllers and truck drivers, whose lapses in focus can have serious consequences.

Humans perform best in a cognitive Goldilocks zone, neither overwhelmed nor bored. Finding that balance is key to optimal performance. Current mental workload assessment relies on the NASA Task Load Index, a lengthy and subjective survey participants complete after performing tasks.

The e-tattoo offers an objective alternative by analyzing electrical activity from the brain and eye movement, in processes known as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG). Unlike EEG caps that are bulky with dangling wires and lathered with squishy gel, the wireless e-tattoo consists of a lightweight battery pack and paper-thin, sticker-like sensors. These sensors feature wavy loops and coils, a design that allows them to stretch and conform seamlessly to the skin for comfort and clear signals.

""What's surprising is those caps, while having more sensors for different regions of the brain, never get a perfect signal because everyone's head shape is different,"" says Lu. ""We measure participants' facial features to manufacture personalized e-tattoos to ensure that the sensors are always in the right location and receiving signals.""

The researchers tested the e-tattoo on six participants who completed a memory challenge that increased in difficulty. As mental load rose, participants showed higher activity in theta and delta brainwaves, signaling increased cognitive demand, while alpha and beta activity decreased, indicating mental fatigue. The results suggest that the device can detect when the brain is struggling.

The device didn't stop at detection. It could also predict mental strain. The researchers trained a computer model to estimate mental workload based on signals from the e-tattoo, successfully distinguishing between different levels of mental workload. The results show that the device can potentially predict mental fatigue.

Cost is another advantage. Traditional EEG equipment can exceed $15,000, while the e-tattoo's chips and battery pack costs $200, and disposable sensors are about $20 each. ""Being low cost makes the device accessible,"" says author Luis Sentis from UT Austin. ""One of my wishes is to turn the e-tattoo into a product we can wear at home.""

While the e-tattoo only works on hairless skin, the researchers are working to combine it with ink-based sensors that work on hair. This will allow for full head coverage and more comprehensive brain monitoring. As robots and new technology increasingly enter workplaces and homes, the team hopes this technology will enhance understanding of human-machine interaction.

""We've long monitored workers' physical health, tracking injuries and muscle strain,"" says Sentis. ""Now we have the ability to monitor mental strain, which hasn't been tracked. This could fundamentally change how organizations ensure the overall well-being of their workforce."""
Medicine,"The liver has a unique structure, especially at the level of individual cells. Hepatocytes, the main liver cells, release bile into tiny channels called bile canaliculi, which drain into the bile duct in the liver periportal region. When this bile drainage system is disrupted, it causes liver damage and disease. Because of this unique architecture, liver disease investigation has been limited by the lack of lab-grown models that accurately show how the disease progresses, as it is challenging to recreate the liver's complex structure and cell interactions in a dish. Existing tissue-derived liver organoid models consist of only one cell type and fail to replicate the complex cellular composition and tissue architecture, such as the liver periportal region.

The research group of Meritxell Huch, director at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics (MPI-CBG) in Dresden, Germany, started to address this issue in a previous study in 2021(Dynamic cell contacts between periportal mesenchyme and ductal epithelium act as a rheostat for liver cell proliferation, Cordero-Espinoza, Lucía et al., Cell Stem Cell, Volume 28, Issue 11)where the researchers developed a liver organoid, consisting of two cell types, cholangiocyte and mesenchyme cells, which was able to model cell-cell interactions and cell arrangement, but still lacked other periportal cell types – most importantly hepatocytes, the cell which builds the majority of liver mass.

In this current study, published in the journalNature, researchers from the group of Meritxell Huch, together with colleagues from the groups of Marino Zerial and Heather Harrington, both also directors at the MPI-CBG, were able to develop a next-generation organoid model, which they named ""periportal assembloid."" This assembloid features adult cholangiocytes and liver mesenchymal cells (as in the previous model), but now additionally also includes hepatocytes, which are the main functional cells of the adult liver. This model combines different cells assembled together in a stepwise process one could compare to LEGO.

""Our assembloid reconstructs the liver periportal region and can model aspects of cholestatic liver injury and biliary fibrosis. We chose this region in particular since it plays a key role in bile transport and is often disrupted in liver diseases when the connection of cells responsible for bile transport is blocked,"" says Anna Dowbaj, one of the first authors, postdoctoral researcher in the Huch group, and from June 2025 appointed assistant professor at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

""To achieve our goal, we first created organoids only consisting of hepatocytes that formed working bile channels and maintained key features of real hepatocytes in the tissue. Then, we added cholangiocytes and fibroblast cells to build periportal assembloids. Our liver model works like real liver tissue, moving bile from inside the liver cells into bile ducts, which shows that we were able to replicate the interactions between the different liver cells,"" explains Aleksandra Sljukic, also first author of the study and a doctoral student in the Huch group.

By manipulating the number of mesenchymal cells, the researchers were able to trigger a response similar to liver fibrosis. They also were able to show that this model can be used to study the roles of specific genes in liver disease by mixing normal and mutated cells or by turning genes off.

Using topological data analysis, Heather Harrington and her colleagues at the University of Oxford classified assembloids' shapes and found that some shapes correlated with better liver function over time.

Meritxell Huch, who oversaw and supervised the study, concludes, ""We are excited that we were able to create a periportal assembloid model that combines, for the first time, portal mesenchyme, cholangiocytes, and hepatocytes. Although some cells are still missing, namely the endothelium and immune cells, the model captures with high precision the cellular and structural architecture of the liver's periportal area at the scale of a tissue culture dish. Additionally, its modular features allow it to be easily studied, handled, and manipulated in the lab. Our liver assembloids are the first all-in-one lab model that can be used to study bile flow, bile duct injury, and how different liver cells contribute to disease.""

New tissue-derived organoid model:A next-generation organoid model, composed of three liver cell types – adult hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, and liver mesenchymal cells – reconstructs the liver periportal region.

Organoid functionality:The complex organoids, or assembloids, are functional, consistently draining bile from the bile canaliculi into the bile duct as in the real liver due to their accurate tissue architecture recapitulation.

Liver disease modelling:This liver model reconstructs the liver periportal region architecture, is able to model aspects of cholestatic liver injury and biliary fibrosis, and can show how different liver cell types contribute to liver disease.

Vision for the future:These periportal liver models could be used in the future to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of liver disease. Once translated to human cells, they might enable drug efficacy and toxicity studies in a more physiologically relevant context."
Medicine,"More than three decades ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) as the first immunotherapy against cancer. And it is still used today to treat early-stage bladder cancer.

Now, a team of researchers from Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) is expanding the understanding of how the treatment works — an understanding that could help improve the effectiveness of immunotherapies more broadly.

BCG is a weakened strain of the bacteriumMycobacterium bovis, which is used worldwide as a vaccine against childhood tuberculosis. In the treatment bladder cancer, BCG is used in higher concentrations, and the assumption has long been that it works primarily by infecting local cancer cells thereby drawing the attention of the patient's immune cells to come and attack the tumor — though exactlyhowit works hasn't been entirely clear. Scientists weren't sure the extent to which the immune response that eliminates the cancer is directed against the bacteria versus the tumor.

In a new study, published May 29 in Cancer Cell, Dr. Glickman and his colleagues showed BCG doesn't just work locally in the bladder, but reprograms and amplifies cells in the bone marrow that give rise to a class of immune cells called myeloid cells — boosting the immune system's ability to fight cancer more generally.

""BCG therapy has been one of the most successful immunotherapies for cancer,"" added Dr. Steven Josefowicz, an associate professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-senior author of the study, along with Dr. Glickman. ""And now it's clear it improves the innate immune system's ability to fight cancer.""

The ""innate"" immune system offers rapid, general defenses against new threats, whereas the ""adaptive"" immune system prepares responses tailored to threats it has previously encountered.

The research combined a sophisticated analysis of blood samples from bladder cancer patients who had been treated with BCG with studies in mouse models of bladder cancer.

The study was led by co-first authors Dr. Andrew Daman, a postdoctoral researcher in the Josefowicz Lab, and Dr. Anthony Antonelli, a postdoc in the Glickman Lab — who initially conceived of and initiated the project as graduate students in the Weill Cornell Medicine Graduate School of Medical Sciences — as well as Dr. Gil Redelman-Sidi, an infectious disease specialist at MSK and member of the Glickman Lab.

Scientists have known that BCG, which is injected into the bladder through a catheter, acts locally as animmunotherapyby improving the ability ofT cellsto eliminate cancer cells. But exactly how this was accomplished wasn't entirely clear.

""Medicine's long understanding has been that in order to work as a treatment, BCG has to be in direct contact with the tumor site,"" Dr. Daman said. ""And you can introduce high concentrations of BCG into the bladder in a way that you can't with other types of cancer, and which doesn't require pumping it throughout the whole body, risking toxic side effects.""

The new study maps BCG's broader effects outside the bladder.

Previous research had shown that when given as a vaccine, BCG bacteria raise the body's general defenses against a variety of other infections, including viruses. A recent clinical trial, for example, found the BCG vaccine helped protect nursing home residents against viral respiratory infections.

Dr. Anthony Antonelli

""So, the question was whether this broader, nonspecific protection that gets stimulated by BCG in the context of infections extends to cancer as well,"" Dr. Antonelli said. ""The scientific understanding had been that BCG was basically confined to the bladder, which is where it was having its effect. But that turns out not to be the full story.""

The team showed that when BCG was administered to mice in their bladders, the bacteria traveled to their bone marrow — and could actually be cultured directly from it.

And it is in the bone marrow, where new immune cells get made, that the bacteria influence the entire body — priming the innate immune system to react to new threats (just as it did for the nursing home residents given BCG vaccinations).

Shifting their attention from mice to bladder cancer patients treated with BCG, the researchers used Progenitor Input Enrichment single cell sequencing (PIE-seq) — a specialized analytical method developed by the Josefowicz Lab — which deeply studies rare circulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from a simple blood draw rather than from a bone marrow sample, the way these cells are typically studied. This approach enabled the researchers to understand how BCG treatment affects stem cells, the early development of immune cells, and the mature myeloid cells that they become.

By comparing gene activity before and after BCG treatment, researchers discovered important changes. The study showed that BCG treatment alters the programming of stem cells and early-stage blood cells in the bone marrow. As a result, new immune cells that develop from these reprogrammed cells become better at fighting tumors.

""These findings show that this training of the innate immune system that happens with the BCG vaccine also happens in the context of bladder administration of BCG to treat cancer,"" Dr. Redelman-Sidi said.

The study was made possible by the ongoing collection of blood samples from BCG-treated bladder cancer patients by MSK urologic surgeon Dr. Eugene Pietzak, who was a co-author of the study. The research also included patients from McGill University.

Additionally, the scientists demonstrated in mice that when BCG was combined with another type of immunotherapy called checkpoint inhibitor therapy, it was better at shrinking tumors and extending life than either treatment alone.

Checkpoint inhibitors work by releasing the ""brake"" on T cells, allowing the body to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. These T cells, in turn, take instruction from the myeloid cells that the paper shows BCG stimulates, creating a synergy between the two approaches.

""So, this has broad implications for immunotherapy more generally,"" Dr. Josefowicz said. ""We now know that this reprogramming of immune cells that happens in the bone marrow that enhances innate immunity responses can be a strategy to enhance the effects of existing immunotherapies.""

Next steps for the research could explore new ways to stimulate this reprogramming, as well as studying whether introducing BCG into the bladder could boost the effectiveness of immunotherapy against other types of cancer.

""Of course, right now that's quite speculative,"" Dr. Glickman noted."
Medicine,"Alcohol is a leading preventable cause of cancer, but public awareness of the connection remains strikingly low in the U.S., with just 40% of American adults recognizing alcohol as a cancer risk, according to a new study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.

The findings, published today inJAMA Oncology, reveal that 39% of American adults are not aware of the connection between cancer and alcohol and an additional 20% are uncertain whether they have heard or read about the link. Additionally, of the 5,937 respondents, just over 30% believe that cancer prevention is not possible.

Consuming alcohol has been linked to at least seven types of cancer, including colorectal, breast, liver, mouth, voice box, throat and esophageal. Each year, alcohol-related cancers claim the lives of more than 20,000 Americans, but nearly 70% of American adults admit to consuming alcoholic beverages. In January 2025, the U.S. Surgeon General issued an advisory about how alcohol increases cancer risk that also called for a new health warning label on alcoholic beverages.

Researchers found that awareness of the link between alcohol and cancer was lowest among Black respondents (30%), those with some college education or less (35.2%), and those who did not believe cancer prevention was possible (31.5%). Alternatively, respondents who had experienced cancer had a higher likelihood of being aware of the connection.

""Given we now know there is an increased risk of cancer, even at low levels of alcohol consumption, it is imperative to improve public awareness,"" Shete said. ""We hope these findings encourage clinicians to speak with their patients directly and that the immediate revision of drinking guidelines becomes a national priority.""

This study was based on data from the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey  and was measured through the question: ""Have you ever heard or read that alcohol increases the risk of cancer?"" Possible responses were: ""yes,"" ""no,"" or ""don't know.""

Limitations may include the design of the survey, which did not allow researchers to establish a causal relationship between awareness and selected variables.

This study was funded by the National Cancer Institute (P30CA016672) and the Betty B. Marcus Chair in Cancer Prevention."
Medicine,"Cannabis has been a globally important crop for millennia. While best known today as marijuana for its psychoactive cannabinoid THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), historically, cannabis has been a cornerstone of human civilization, providing seed oil, textiles, and food for more than 10,000 years. Today, cannabis remains an understudied and underutilized resource, but United States legislation passed in 2014 and 2018 have re-energized cannabis crop development for medicinal, grain, and fiber applications.

Researchers from the Salk Institute have created the most comprehensive, high-quality, and detailed genetic atlas of cannabis to date. The team analyzed 193 different cannabis genomes (entire sets of genetic information), revealing an unprecedented diversity, complexity, and untapped opportunity within this foundational agricultural species. This landmark achievement was the result of a multi-year collaboration with Oregon CBD, Oregon State University, and the HudsonAlpha Institute of Biotechnology.

The findings, published inNatureon May 28, 2025, set the stage for transformative advances in cannabis-based agriculture, medicine, and industry.

Cannabis sativa, also known as hemp, is a flowering plant native to Asia. Cannabis has many unique features that have made it a prominent crop over the course of human history, like its ability to produce strong fibers for textiles or its medicinal qualities stemming from its being one of the few plants to make high quantities of cannabinoids. Innovators today suggest that cannabis oil could rival canola or soybean with the right breeding, or that cannabis derivatives could even be used as a sustainable alternative to jet fuel.

Cannabis is a chemical powerhouse. It can produce more than 30% by dry weight as terpenes and cannabinoids, small chemicals that the plant makes to protect against predators, yet humans leverage for mood-altering purposes. Terpenes create the exquisite aromas that attract us to fruits and flowers, while cannabinoids interact with the human body to provide many therapeutic properties. One cannabinoid, the non-psychedelic cannabidiol (CBD), expanded the public's view of cannabis when the ""Charlotte's Web"" strain was used to treat epileptic seizures. CBD, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and more than 100 other poorly studied cannabinoids have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including pain, arthritis, nausea, asthma, depression, and anxiety.

Importantly, the impact this selective breeding has had on cannabis's genomic diversity has remained a mystery. Solving this mystery has proven difficult since cannabis has a complicated genome. First, cannabis is among the less than 5% of plants to have distinct female and male sexes on separate plants. Second, cannabis genomes contain many transposable elements, which are repetitive stretches of DNA that can ""jump"" around the genome and are thus difficult to track.

Scientists use a technology called sequencing to determine the patterns of nucleic acids, which connect across DNA's double helix to form base pairs, along DNA strands. Traditional short-read sequencing methods chop up the DNA to investigate it piece by piece, just a few hundred base pairs at a time. Newer long-read sequencing techniques can capturethousandsof base pairs at once.

""There are limits to what you can discover with short-read sequencing technologies, since those short genetic excerpts are impossible to stitch together in any meaningful way when looking at complex regions of the genome, especially repetitive DNA sequences,"" says co-first author Lillian Padgitt-Cobb, a postdoctoral researcher in Michael's lab. ""We're among the first to harness this long-read technology at scale in the pangenome context, and with that comes all these insights into structural variation and gene ordering that can inform end-game decisions about breeding favorable traits into cannabis plants.""

The study isn't the first to use long-read sequencing-in fact, Michael himself was the first researcher to generate a chromosome-level genome of cannabis using long-read sequencing back in 2018, which revealed complex genetic architecture where cannabinoids are synthesized, and explained the breeding history behind anti-epileptic Charlotte's Web. Where this new study stands apart is its completeness. It contains the most genomes yet, and is the first to include sex chromosomes and, relatedly, the first to have haplotype resolution.

Cannabis is adiploidplant. This means that, like humans, it contains two sets of chromosomes, one set inherited from a male plant and the other from a female plant. While most genomes published to date have only been able to decode one chromosome, also known as haplotype resolution, the team resolvedbothsets of cannabis chromosomes. By looking at both chromosome sets, the researchers revealed an unprecedented amount of genetic variation-possibly up to 20 times that of humans.

""With this haplotype resolution,"" Padgitt-Cobb explains, ""we can look at what was inherited from just one of the parent plants and start to understand the breeding and background of that plant.""

The team's study collected genomes from 144 different cannabis plants from around the world to assemble 193 total genomes-181 of which had never been catalogued before. The genome total is greater than the plant total owing to that haplotype resolution, since each plant that had both chromosome sets investigated produced two genome assemblies. Collectively, these many genomes make up the pangenome, which was analyzed to understand the full extent of genetic diversity within the cannabis species.

The high quality of the collected genomes allowed the researchers to resolve previously unseen genetic patterns, including the architecture of genes responsible for cannabinoid synthesis, and, by incorporating sex chromosomes, a first look at cannabis Y chromosomes.

Their first discovery was that there is unexpected diversity within the species. Across the pangenome, 23% of genes were found in every genome, 55% werenearlyuniversal (seen in 95%–99% of genomes), 21% were in between 5% and 94% of genomes, and less than 1% were entirely unique. Some of the most universal genes were those that produce cannabinoids.

While cannabinoid genes were consistent across genomes, genes related to fatty acid metabolism, growth, and defense were not. These variable genes are an untapped breeding pool, and their selective breeding could also make cannabis more robust in the field or improve the nutritional content of hemp oil to make it a competitor among existing seed oils. Notably, the research team discovered that structural variation in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway contributes to the production of tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), a rare varin-type cannabinoid gaining attention for its non-psychoactive, energizing effects.

Looking more closely at cannabinoid genes across the pangenome, the researchers concluded that two genes, THCAS and CBDAS, are likely under strong selective pressure from human-directed breeding for THC and CBD content. Importantly, they found that cannabinoid genes are located in transposable elements. Selectively breeding for genes inside these ""jumping"" transposable elements has, in turn, created immense diversity among cannabis plants.

The researchers also identified interesting targets for agricultural optimization. First, by looking at the differences between European and Asian genomes, they concluded there is likely an ancient cannabis relative somewhere in Asia waiting to be discovered. This wild relative will have novel genetic adaptations related to its unique environmental history, making it a wealth of information for breeding cannabis plants that are more resilient crops.

Finally, the novel insight into sex chromosomes revealed that there are genesonlypresent in ""father"" plants that can be used to breed better-performing offspring. Modern marijuana breeding leverages ""feminization,"" where farmers induce a female plant to make male flowers-entirely bypassing the Y chromosome. These new findings suggest that breeding programs may be missing valuable genetic diversity and trait potential encoded in those bypassed male genomes. Incorporating true male plants into breeding strategies could unlock overlooked genetic gains and expand opportunities for crop improvement.

""Over the last 10 years, breeders have already done a decent job of getting yields up and making cannabis an economically viable crop,"" says co-first author Ryan Lynch, a postdoctoral researcher in Michael's lab. ""Once there's market interest there, paired with these new insights into cannabis genomes that can guide breeding efforts, I can see hemp and hemp oils really booming in both human health and industry applications.""

In the short term, the team hopes the pangenome will serve as a dynamic resource for researchers around the world to build upon and use to inform cultivation strategies, helping to realize the untapped potential of cannabis as a valuable multi-use crop grown for fiber, seed oil, and medicine.

Medicine,"A relatively new therapy used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension in those with mild to moderate disease was found to be effective at preventing death in those with more advanced disease. Results were published on Wednesday, May 28, inThe New England Journal of Medicineand could have ""transformative implications"" for patients, according to an editorial that accompanied the study written by Bradley Maron, MD, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Hypertension Program at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.

When the US Food and Drug approved the first-in-its-class drug, called sotatercept, last year, it was indicated only for those with mild pulmonary arterial hypertension to increase exercise capacity and prevent clinical worsening of the lung condition which is rare but progressive, often leading to premature death. About 1,000 Americans are diagnosed with the condition every year, and women under age 60 are at higher risk. The condition, caused by a narrowing of small arteries throughout the lungs, triggers the heart to work harder and eventually lose its ability to effectively pump blood.

The clinical trial, called Zenith, was led by researchers in France and conducted at several clinical sites in the U.S. and internationally. It involved 172 patients with advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension who were randomly assigned to get an injection of sotatercept along with their usual treatments or to get a placebo injection along with their usual treatments.

""The authors observed a 76 percent lower risk of a primary endpoint event [death from any cause, lung transplantation, or hospitalization] with sotatercept than with a placebo – a staggering effect by any standard by uniquely relevant in pulmonary arterial hypertension, since previous trials have typically shown comparatively modest results with weaker end points,"" wrote Dr. Maron, who is also Director of the University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing. Dr. Maron was not involved in the study and provided an independent assessment of the study findings.

The trial was stopped early after it became clear that the sotatercept group had significant benefits over those taking a placebo: 50 percent of the placebo group were hospitalized during the trial compared to only 9 percent of the sotatercept group. Death occurred in 15 percent of those on a placebo compared to 8 percent of those on sotatercept.

Vascular malformations and bleeding events occurred in some patients taking sotatercept, but this did not lead them to stop taking the drug. Nonetheless, better understanding of how these side effects could relate to patient adherence to sotatercept in actual clinical practice is needed, according to Dr. Maron.

""Results from the Zenith trial,"" he wrote, ""offer a key measure of optimism to patients with advanced-stage pulmonary arterial hypertension with limited or no options."""
Medicine,"A ""fine-tuned"" artificial intelligence (AI) tool shows promise for objective evaluation of patients with facial palsy, reports an experimental study in the June issue ofPlastic and Reconstructive Surgery®,the official medical journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS). The journal is published in the Lippincott portfolio by Wolters Kluwer.

Patients with facial palsy have paralysis or partial loss of movement of the face, caused by nerve injury due to tumors, surgery, trauma, or other causes. Detailed assessment is essential for evaluating treatment options, such as nerve transfer surgery, but poses difficult challenges.

Various subjective scoring systems have been developed but have problems with variability. Objective assessments have been described but are impractical for routine clinical use. Machine learning and AI models are a potential approach for routine, objective assessment of facial palsy.

Dr. Kimura and colleagues evaluated a previous AI-developed facial recognition model, called 3D-FAN, in patients with facial palsy. That system was trained to recognize 68 facial keypoints, such as eyebrows and eyelids, nose and mouth, and facial contours.

When applied to clinical videos, 3D-FAN – trained on images of people with normal facial movement – was clearly insufficient in assessing facial palsy. The system was prone to miss facial asymmetry in facial palsy, including when patients were instructed to smile; and failed to recognize when the eyes were closed.

Dr Kimura and colleagues attempted to ""fine-tune"" the model using machine-learning, based on 1,181 images from clinical videos of 196 patients with facial palsy. In this process, facial landmarks were manually relocated to the correct position, with steps to minimize variability. Training sessions were then repeated until there was no further improvement in accuracy.

""After machine learning, we found qualitative and quantitative improvement in the detection of facial keypoints by the AI,"" Dr. Kimura and colleagues write. The refined model showed substantially lower error rates, with improvement in keypoint detection in every area of the face, including the eyelids and mouth – key areas of asymmetry in facial palsy. The article includes illustrations clearly showing the improvement in keypoint detection after machine learning.

The authors believe their ""fine-tuning"" method – with manual correction of landmarks in a limited number of images – ""holds potential for broader applications of making AI-assisted models in other relatively rare disorders."" Pending further evaluation, the researchers plan to make their AI model freely available to other researchers and clinicians.

""Considering our software as one of promising solutions for objective assessment of facial palsy, we are now conducting a multidisciplinary analysis of the effectiveness of this system,"" Dr. Kimura and coauthors conclude. By providing an objective score, the AI tool may enable more accurate ratings of the severity of facial palsy as well as a quantitative tool for assessing treatment outcomes."
Medicine,"The World Health Organization (WHO), Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom announced today the expansion of the successful Health Security Partnership to Strengthen Disease Surveillance in Africa (HSPA) to seven countries on the continent.

Africa experiences more disease outbreaks than any other part of the world. While significant progress has been made in strengthening disease surveillance over the past decade, no country can tackle today's complex health threats alone.

The Health Security Partnership strengthens disease surveillance and epidemic intelligence across the African continent, enabling countries to better detect and respond to public health threats - whether they are natural, accidental or deliberate. Launched in 2023 in six countries, The Gambia, Mali, Morocco, Namibia, South Africa and Tunisia, the partnership will expand to Rwanda in its second phase which runs from 2025 to 2028.

At the heart of the initiative is a collaborative surveillance approach that connects health and security sectors to reduce biological risks and strengthen surveillance systems nationally and internationally. HSPA is aligned with the health security objectives of the Global Partnership Against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction and the Signature Initiative to Mitigate Biological Threats in Africa (SIMBA).

The partnership is supporting countries to strengthen capacities in biorisk management, event and indicator-based surveillance, genomic surveillance and epidemic intelligence. This is achieved through training, guidance development, co-creation of implementation roadmaps, and hands-on technical assistance to ensure that implementation is aligned with country priorities, embedded within broader national systems, and built for long-term sustainability.""Within the framework of this project, Africa CDC will work with the Member States in mobilizing political will for biosecurity and surveillance, establishing regional frameworks for bio-surveillance of high-consequence biological agents and toxins, and coordinating event-based surveillance. The collaboration with other partners and coordination with Member States is crucial especially in the current context of limited resources to strengthen the continent's capacity for early detection, response, and management of biological threats,""said Dr Raji Tajudeen, Acting Deputy Director General and Head, Division of Public Health Institutes and Research, Africa CDC.

The HSPA initiative has been supported from the start by the Government of Canada's Weapons Threat Reduction Program, with additional funding in phase two from the Government of the United Kingdom.

Building on the achievements in phase one, the participating countries, with support from WHO and partners, will accelerate implementation to build a healthier, safer and more resilient Africa."
Medicine,"A lab-designed molecule developed and extensively studied by scientists with Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC could represent a breakthrough in slowing tumor recurrence in glioblastoma, an aggressive and deadly form of brain cancer.

In a study published in May inCell Death and Disease, researchers identified a previously unknown trait of cancer cells that shows promise for therapeutic intervention. The group outlined the mechanism of action and effectiveness of the experimental drug known as JM2, revealing its potential as a peptide therapy to target cancer cells that can renew and regrow, even after chemotherapy and radiation.

Glioblastoma, the most common form of malignant brain tumor, is particularly difficult to treat. The median survival after diagnosis is just over 14 months.

Treatment typically involves surgically removing as much of the tumor as possible, followed by radiation and chemotherapy with a drug called temozolomide. However, glioblastoma always recurs due to the presence of treatment-resistant glioblastoma stem cells. These cancer cells can survive, even after standard therapies, leading to tumor regrowth.

The Lamouille lab studies how cancer cells communicate with each other and with their surrounding environment, with a particular focus on connexin 43. That protein plays a key role in forming gap junctions, which enable direct cell-to-cell communication.

""Connexin 43 plays a complex role in cancer,"" Lamouille said. ""Depending on its expression and localization in cancer cells, it can both suppress and support cancer growth.""

Experimenting with laboratory-grown glioblastoma stem-like cells, Lamouille turned to super-resolution microscopy, a powerful technique that allows researchers to visualize and localize proteins at nanoscale.

Associate Professor James Smyth specializes in this technique to study gap junctions and connexin proteins in heart disease. Together, they discovered for the first time that connexin 43 is strongly associated with microtubules in these cells, decorating them along their entire length.

Building on this discovery, Lamouille came up with the idea to use JM2, a connexin 43-derived peptide that mimics the microtubule-interacting domain of connexin 43, to further explore its role in glioblastoma stem cells.

Rob Gourdie, the Heywood Fralin professor at the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute, developed the JM2 peptide with his laboratory while at the Medical University of South Carolina.

""When we tested JM2 in glioblastoma stem-like cells, that was the most exciting moment,"" Lamouille said. ""Not only did that efficiently disrupt connexin 43 interaction with microtubules, but JM2 was also toxic specifically for these particular cells, leaving healthy brain cells unharmed.""

It achieved the effect without affecting connexin 43's other crucial functions.

Beyond glioblastoma, the work represents a significant step toward identifying a novel tumorigenic function for connexin 43.

""I can remember presentations by the team in which the three-dimensional gliospheres used to model tumors in the culture dish were clearly getting smaller,"" said co-author Gourdie. ""It was surprising to see such a drastic effect on glioblastoma. The JM2 peptide had a killing effect by itself. That was unexpected.""

Through further testing in both cell cultures and living organisms, the researchers found that JM2 disrupts the maintenance of these treatment-resistant cancer cells in laboratory experiments and significantly slows tumor growth in animal models. These findings support JM2 as a promising new peptide-based drug for targeting the glioblastoma stem cells that drive tumor recurrence following treatment.

The research also highlights the partnership between Virginia Tech's Fralin Biomedical Research Institute and Carilion Clinic, a health system in Southwest Virginia.

Co-author Michael Lunski was a Carilion Clinic resident who conducted research in Lamouille's laboratory, which is adjacent to that of Assistant Professor Zhi Sheng. Sheng provided glioblastoma cells that helped lead to the discovery; these lab cultures were derived from tumor cells donated with the consent of brain cancer patients in Southwest Virginia receiving care from Carilion physicians.

While more research is needed to develop the therapy for use and determine whether it will be safe and effective in humans, preclinical findings suggest that combining JM2 with chemotherapy could improve patients' survival by slowing recurrence.

To advance the approach, Lamouille is now experimenting with novel delivery mechanisms specifically targeting the JM2 peptide to glioblastoma cells, including biodegradable nanoparticles and viral vectors.

Lamouille and Gourdie are co-founders of Acomhal Research Inc., which licensed the JM2 peptide in an effort to bring new therapies to cancer patients."
Medicine,"The global measles outbreak must trigger an urgent debate into whether a vaccine should be recommended earlier to better protect against the highly contagious disease during infancy, a new review states.

The systematic review, led by Murdoch Children's Research Institute (MCRI), found vaccinating children from as early as four months of age for measles warranted serious discussion given that only 30 per cent of babies in low- and middle-income countries were protected by maternal antibodies by four months of age. Concerningly, this is well below the World Health Organization's (WHO) recommendation of a first measles dose between 9-12 months old.

The WHO recommends a two-dose measles vaccine schedule for all children. In many low- and middle-income countries, the first dose is given at nine months and the second dose at 15-18 months. But the exception applies in outbreak situations where vaccination at six months is recommended in addition to the routine two-dose schedule.

Published inThe Journal of Infectious Diseases, the review spanned 34 journal articles with data from 8000 babies under nine months of age from low- and middle-income countries. It found maternal measles antibody rates were highest at birth, 81 per cent, before decreasing rapidly to 30 per cent by four months and 18 per cent at seven months.

MCRI Dr. Lien Anh Ha Do said when a first dose had been administered between four to seven months of age it produced a positive immune response and was highly effective in preventing measles.

But MCRI Professor Kim Mulholland said several barriers existed including the cost-effectiveness of more doses, addressing vaccine hesitancy and uptake and an earlier first dose could also reduce the vaccine'sefficacyas the child ages.

""School-aged children are the key transmitters of the virus, so preventing infections during childhood is critical to limiting the disease spread and advancing measles elimination efforts,"" he said.

""But a trade-off of an earlier first dose is a possible more rapid reduction of measles antibodies in children vaccinated early in infancy. Additionally, adding a third dose will be challenging given that low- and middle-income countries are already struggling to administer a second dose within the current measles vaccination program.""

MCRI researcher Darren Ong said to attainherd immunityagainst measles transmission at least 95 per cent of a population needed to receive both first and second doses.

""Achieving and maintaining this coverage is a significant challenge,"" he said. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened the situation by interrupting global routine immunisation and catch-up campaigns as well as fuelling vaccine hesitancy.

""A highly contagious airborne virus, measles causes significant impacts especially in young babies who rely on sufficient herd immunity. Poor vaccination coverage has sparked large measles outbreaks in several countries since early 2024.""

The current surge in measles infections has been significant, with almost 400,000 measles cases reported globally in 2024 and more than 16,000 during the first two months of 2025.

MCRI Associate Professor Claire von Mollendorf said new and innovative approaches were needed to better control and manage this global health crisis.

""There has been little improvement in global measles control over the past two decades and it's likely the situation will only get drastically worse,"" she said.

""Rapid diagnostic testing would greatly improve surveillance systems for early detection and monitoring of outbreaks to guide public health responses. New randomised control trials to evaluate the effectiveness of an earlier dosing schedule would also help protect babies who were inadequately protected by maternal antibodies.""

New Zealand has recently recommended an additional measles dose be given to children as young as four months before travelling to endemic countries."
Medicine,"University of Virginia School of Medicine scientists have uncovered a key reason why HIV remains so difficult to cure: Their research shows that small changes in the virus affect how quickly or slowly it replicates, and how easily or stubbornly it can reawaken from hiding. These insights bring researchers closer to finding ways to flush out the dormant virus and eliminate it for good.

Thanks to remarkable progress in HIV treatment, the virus can often be suppressed to undetectable levels in the blood, eliminating most disease symptoms, and preventing transmission to others. But HIV never truly goes away. Instead, it hides in the body in a dormant, or ""latent,"" state, and if medications are ever stopped it can reemerge. In this stealth mode, the virus evades both antiretroviral drugs and the immune system, posing one of the biggest challenges to finding a cure.

UVA's new findings reveal a critical clue to how HIV controls this hiding act. The research shows that subtle variations in a viral control system, known as the Rev-RRE axis, influence how efficiently the virus replicates and how easily it reactivates from latency. Some versions of this system make the virus more aggressive, while others keep it less active and harder to bring out of hiding for elimination.

""Early on many scientists thought that the Rev-RRE axis was merely an on-off switch for the virus. However, our recent studies have shown that it functions more like a rheostat,"" said Marie-Louise Hammarskjold, MD, PhD, associate director of UVA's Myles H. Thaler Center for AIDS and Human Retrovirus Research in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Cancer Biology.

""We've known for some time that the Rev-RRE axis varied in activity,"" said David Rekosh, PhD, director of the center. ""This study links it directly to how well the virus can replicate and re-activate from latency.""

To replicate, HIV must export its RNA – its cellular operating instructions – from the nucleus of infected cells. It does this using a coordinated system involving a viral protein called Rev and a special RNA structure called the Rev Response Element, or RRE. UVA's new research shows that small changes in this regulatory system directly impact HIV's ability to replicate and emerge from latency. The study found that viruses with low Rev activity had a disadvantage in both replication and latency reactivation.

This variability helps explain why HIV persists despite aggressive treatment. To develop a cure, future therapies may need to account for these subtle variations that allow the virus to shift its behavior, the researchers say.

""Rev has often been overlooked in the context of latency, even though it's essential for HIV replication. Our work helps explain why some current 'shock and kill' approaches struggle to fully reactivate the virus,"" said Godfrey Dzhivhuho, PhD, the other lead author of the study. ""If a portion of the viral reservoir has low Rev-RRE activity, it will be more resistant to reactivation. By enhancing the Rev-RRE axis, we may be able to induce a stronger and more complete latency reversal and bring us closer to strategies that can truly clear the virus.""

Dzhivhuho first met Rekosh and Hammarskjold years ago when they were teaching summer sessions at the University of Venda in South Africa, a country where more than 8 million people live with HIV. He later obtained his PhD in HIV immunology from the University of Cape Town and now devotes his career to better understanding HIV and other infectious diseases as part of UVA's Thaler Center.

""Coming from South Africa, where HIV affects so many lives, I've always wanted to be part of the effort to end this epidemic,"" Dzhivhuho said. ""I hope this work brings us one step closer to a cure, not just by uncovering how the virus works, but by helping design smarter strategies to finally eliminate it. That's what drives me every day in this research.""

The researchers have published their findings in the scientific journalPLOS Pathogens. The research team included Godfrey A. Dzhivhuho, Patrick E.H. Jackson, Ethan S. Honeycutt, Flavio da Silva Mesquita, Jing Huang, Marie-Louise Hammarskjold, and David Rekosh. A full list of disclosures is available in the publication.

Medicine,"Researchers have identified C5aR1 as a novel biomarker for metastasis risk and poor prognosis in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), the most common type of metastatic skin cancer. The new study's findings inThe American Journal of Pathology, published by Elsevier, found that C5aR1 promotes the invasion of cSCC tumor cells. Its elevated presence suggests that C5aR1 might serve as a useful prognostic marker for metastatic disease and, potentially, a target for future therapies in advanced cSCC.

The incidence of cSCC is increasing. Exposure to solar UV radiation is the predominant risk factor for cSCC. Approximately 3% to 5% of primary cSCCs metastasize, and the prognosis for patients with metastatic cSCC is poor. Although most cases are curable by excision of the primary tumor, a subset of patients develop aggressive and metastatic disease with few treatment options. It is estimated that cSCC accounts for nearly 25% of annual skin cancer deaths.Lead investigator Veli-Matti Kähäri, MD, PhD, Department of Dermatology, and FICAN West Cancer Research Laboratory University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, explains,""Currently, there are no established molecular markers in clinical practice for predicting themetastasisrisk of primary cSCCs. There is an urgent need for predictive biomarkers for the prognosis of cSCC and for new therapeutic targets for metastatic cSCC.""Studies in multiple cancers have indicated that the complement system, which is a part of the human innate immune system and is a tumor-suppressing cytolytic mechanism, can also contribute to tumor progression and metastasis by inducinginflammationor causing immunosuppression. This prompted researchers conducting the current study to investigate the interaction between C5a (which acts as a signaling molecule in cancer) and its protein receptor C5aR1 (which is found on the surface of cells) in cSCC.Investigators noted that when C5a binds to C5aR1, it activates signaling pathways within the cell, leading to changes in cell behavior. They examined C5aR1 in the context of cSCC progression and metastasis by combiningin vitro3D spheroid co-culture of cSCC cells and skin fibroblasts, human cSCC xenograft tumors grown in SCID (Severe Combined Immunodeficiency) mice, and a large panel of patient-derived tumor samples of non-metastatic cSCC, metastatic cSCCs and cSCC metastases.First author Lauri Heiskanen, MD, Department of Dermatology, and FICAN West Cancer Research Laboratory University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, elaborates,""We observed that fibroblasts in the tumor microenvironment induced C5aR1 expression in cSCC cells. Exposure to recombinant C5a further increased the invasiveness of cSCC cells. In patient-derived cSCC samples, high C5aR1 expression — both in tumor cells and in stromal fibroblasts — was linked to metastasis risk and poor survival.""Researchers were surprised to find that fibroblasts influenced C5aR1 expression in cancer cells, and that the C5aR1 expression in stromal fibroblasts also had a role in metastasis and poor prognosis in cSCC. They also had not anticipated that C5aR1 expression would correlate with patient outcomes across a large clinical sample set.Co-investigators Pilvi Riihilä, MD, PhD, and Liisa Nissinen, PhD, Department of Dermatology, and FICAN West Cancer Research Laboratory University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, conclude, ""What is particularly interesting in the results of our study is how the tumor microenvironment — especially fibroblasts in this study — affects progression of cSCC through C5aR1. It emphasizes the idea that the interplay between tumor cells and stromal cells plays an important role in cancer progression. Our findings suggest that C5aR1 is a potential metastatic risk marker, a novel prognosticbiomarker, and promising therapeutic target for cSCC."""
Medicine,"According to the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, approximately 1 in 6 children in the United States have developmental disabilities which include physical, learning, language or behavior-related disabilities. Students with disabilities often receive accommodations (how students access and learn the same content as their classmates) at school, but teachers rarely explain them to typically-developing classmates. Children with disabilities are increasingly included in general education classrooms alongside typically-developing classmates. Accommodations such as an adult helper to work one-on-one with the student, preferential seating, or extra time to navigate the school between classes ensure the success of many children with disabilities in these settings. When teachers do not discuss accommodations or their purpose with typically-developing classmates, those classmates may have to make sense of the accommodations themselves.

The current study examined how five to nine-year-olds evaluate children with disabilities who engage in accommodation-related behavior (e.g., taking extra time on tests/assignments, going to lunch/recess early, playing games differently). The study included 122 children ranging from 5- to 9- years (61 males; 61 females) who lived in Tennessee or had recently moved from Tennessee to another state in the United States. The majority of the participants were white with upper-middle-class backgrounds (87.7%), followed by Asian/Asian American (9.8%), Hispanic or Latino (4.1%), Black/African American (3.3%), and Native American (.8%). (These categories were not mutually exclusive; parents could select more than one.) Most parents reported that their highest level of education was a master's degree (36.9%). An experimenter showed children a slideshow where several characters with either physical (walking) or cognitive (learning) disabilities engaged in physical accommodations (e.g., goes outside to recess first) or cognitive accommodations (e.g., has an adult helper in class). Participants were asked to evaluate the fairness of these accommodations, and to provide their explanations for why characters engaged in these accommodation-related behaviors.

The findings showed that with increasing age, children evaluated disability-related accommodations as increasingly fair. Older children also demonstrated greater understanding of how specific accommodations help to address specific needs, which might account for why they judged accommodations as fairer. The research was featured in a newChild Developmentarticle with authors from Vanderbilt University, in the United States.

These findings may encourage teachers, parents, and service providers to discuss the ways that accommodations address the needs of persons with disabilities. The Society for Research in Child Development (SRCD) had the opportunity to speak with lead author Dr. Nicolette G. Granata to learn more about the research.

SRCD:Can you please provide a brief overview of the study?

Dr. Granata:In this study, we investigated how young children, 5-9-years-old, evaluate the fairness of and explain accommodations that are common in elementary school classrooms, such as playing games or sports differently, going to recess or lunch first, or receiving extra help in the classroom. Children reasoned about other children with either physical (walking) or cognitive (learning disabilities) engaging in walking-related (e.g., playing soccer with one's hands) or learning-related classroom accommodations (e.g., having an adult helper with classwork), and were asked to imagine that they were a part of this classroom, too. Children first provided their reasoning for why these other children in the hypothetical classroom may have engaged in these behaviors and then evaluated whether these behaviors were fair or not, on a scale from ""very unfair"" to ""very fair"". We were interested in children's evaluations of the accommodation-related behaviors, their explanations for the behaviors, and the associations between their evaluations and reasoning.

SRCD: Did you learn anything that surprised you?

Dr. Granata:Absolutely! Regardless of age, children who accounted for accommodation-related behaviors (like going to recess first) in terms of addressing theneedsof children with disabilities(versus their wants or desires), evaluated that behavior as more fair. We were surprised that this was the case whether children could articulate exactlywhya certain character with a disability needed an accommodation (""he needs to go outside first because he can't walk as well and it takes him longer than other kids""),or,simply understood that a need was present (""because he needs to""). Why does this matter? Because it means that children may not need to know all the details about a particular disability or accommodation to demonstrate flexibility, understanding, and acceptance.

SRCD:Can you please explain how this research might be helpful for teachers, parents and administrators?

Dr. Granata:My sense of why many teachers feel wary to formally discuss disability in the classroom is because they fear that children won't understand the nuances of the many types of disabilities their classmates may have, or that children might resent their classmates for having certain accommodations, or that pointing out a disability might lead to children treating the disabled classmate negatively. This study demonstrates that even young children generally felt neutral about the fairness of unexplained accommodations for classmates with disabilities, and children who were older or who expressed an understanding that accommodations addressed people's needs generally evaluated the accommodations as fair. Thus, this study demonstrates to teachers, parents, and administrators that it might be worthwhile to begin these discussions in elementary school, emphasizing how accommodations work to address the unique needs of persons with disabilities. Children are likely noticing disabilities and accommodations anyway, and are likely curious about the reasons for accommodations, so why not help guide children with accurate and empathic information?

SRCD:Can you please address some of the research limitations?

Dr. Granata:Some limitations of our study were that disabilities were only described to children (""He walks differently"") rather than visually depicted, meaning children may have interpreted the severity of any given disability differently. This was an intentional methodological decision, but this is of course not how most children will witness persons with disabilities in the real-world. As well, exploratory analyses in our study revealed that children who more often interacted with persons with disabilities evaluated accommodations more fairly; because our sample was largely middle to upper-middle class, perhaps children in our study had more exposure to accommodations and other disability-related services than participants from lower income communities, leading to their generally neutral or positive evaluations of the fairness of accommodations. We need to know more about how children in different communities evaluate and reason about the fairness of disability accommodations.

SRCD:What's next in this field of research?

Dr. Granata:Future research should continue to explore how children evaluate and reason about the fairness of accommodations for people with disabilities in more diverse samples, as well as more specifically examine how children's evaluations of accommodations vary along with what they are taught in school – both explicitly and implicitly. Children's concepts of disabled persons continue to be understudied when compared to their concepts of other minority groups; we encourage continued study in this field in order to build a more inclusive and accepting society for those with differences throughout the lifespan.

Medicine,"The process of necrosis, a form of cell death, may represent one of the most promising ways to change the course of human aging, disease and even space travel, according to a new study from researchers at UCL, drug discovery company LinkGevity and the European Space Agency (ESA).

In the study, published inNature Oncogene, a world-leading international team of scientists and clinicians explore the potential of necrosis – when cells die unexpectedly as a result of infection, injury or disease – to reshape our understanding and treatment of age-related conditions.

Challenging prevailing views, the paper brings together evidence from cancer biology, regenerative medicine, kidney disease, and space health to argue that necrosis is not merely an endpoint, but a key driver of aging that presents an opportunity for intervention.

Dr. Keith Siew, an author of the study from UCL Centre for Kidney & Bladder Health, said: ""Nobody really likes talking about death, even cell death, which is perhaps why the physiology of death is so poorly understood. And in a way necrosis is death. If enough cells die, then tissues die, then we die. The question is what would happen if we could pause or stop necrosis.""

Dr. Carina Kern, lead author of the study and CEO of LinkGevity, a biotech company based at Cambridge's Babraham Research Campus and part of the NASA Space-Health program, said: ""Necrosis remains one of the last frontiers in medicine – a common thread across aging, disease, space biology, and scientific progress itself.""

Cells are the fundamental building blocks of life and can die in various ways. 'Programmed' forms of cell death are beneficial, carefully orchestrated processes that allow our tissues to replenish themselves and function well throughout life.

But 'unprogrammed' cell death, or necrosis, is an uncontrolled and catastrophic process that leads to tissue degeneration and biological decline.

At the centre of the necrotic process is calcium, a vital resource that effectively controls the cell by determining which functions are switched on or off. Calcium ions are normally maintained at a level that is 10,000 to 100,000 times higher outside the cell than inside of it.

When this finely tuned balance fails, calcium floods the cell like an electrical short circuit, pushing the cell into chaos. Unlike programmed death, where cells dismantle in an orderly manner, necrosis causes cells to rupture, spilling toxic molecules into surrounding tissues.

This sparks a chain reaction that causes widespreadinflammationand affects tissue repair, creating a snowball effect that ultimately leads to frailty and the onset of chronic age-related conditions such as kidney disease, heart disease and Alzheimer's.

Dr. Siew added: ""When cells die, it's not always a peaceful process for the neighbours.""

Notably, it is in the kidneys that necrosis may have its most devastating and underappreciated impact. Necrosis induces kidney disease, which can lead to kidney failure requiring a transplant or dialysis. By age 75 nearly half of all individuals develop some degree of kidney disease as part of the natural aging process.

Dr. Siew added: ""With kidney disease, there's no one underlying reason that the kidneys fail. It could be a lack of oxygen, inflammation, oxidative stress, a build-up of toxins, and so on. All of these stressors eventually lead to necrosis, which initiates a positive feedback loop that spirals out of control, leading to kidney failure. We can't stop all of these stressors, but if you could intervene at the point of necrosis, you'd effectively achieve the same result.""

Another area where interrupting necrosis could have a big impact is spaceflight, where astronauts often experience accelerated aging and kidney-related decline due to the effects of low gravity and exposure to cosmic radiation. A 2024 study involving Dr Siew demonstrated that the human kidney may be the ultimate bottleneck for long-duration space missions.

The authors say finding solutions to this accelerated aging and kidney disease may be the final frontier for human deep space exploration.

Professor Damian Bailey, an author of the paper from the University of South Wales and Chair of the European Space Agency (ESA) Life Sciences Working Group, said: ""Targeting necrosis offers potential to not only transform longevity on Earth but also push the frontiers of space exploration. In space, the same factors that cause aging on Earth are made worse by cosmic radiation and microgravity – speeding up degeneration dramatically.""

Dr. Kern added: ""In many age-related diseases – affecting diverse organs such as the lungs, kidneys, liver, brain, and cardiovascular system – relentless cascades of necrosis fuel the progression of disease. This is often alongside impaired healing that leads to fibrosis, inflammation and damaged cells. Each cascade triggers and amplifies the next.

""If we could prevent necrosis, even temporarily, we would be shutting down these destructive cycles at their source, enabling normal physiological processes and cell division to resume – and potentially even allowing for regeneration.""

The paper is a collaborative effort by clinicians and scientists from institutions including UCL Division of Medicine, Harvard Medical School-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital, Mayo Clinic, NASA Space-Health program, MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of South Wales, and the European Space Agency."
Medicine,"CAR T cell immunotherapy, which uses a patient's own modified immune cells to find and destroy cancer cells, can produce dramatic results when treating blood cancers like lymphoma and leukemia and shows promise against solid tumors.

But harvestingT cells, a type of white blood cell that helps the immune system fight germs and protect against disease, is difficult and expensive-limiting the use of this potentially life-saving therapy to major cancer centers and after other treatments have failed.

Now a team of researchers at Case Western Reserve University is developing a new device to harvest T cells that might make CAR T cell therapy less expensive and more widely available. The device, called CAPGLO (for capture and glow), uses a magnetic field to ""capture"" T cells and visualize them with fluorescent tags that make them ""glow.""

The laboratories of Robert Brown, a physicist in the university's College of Arts and Sciences, Susann Brady-Kalnay, a cell biologist, and David Wald, an immunologist at the School of Medicine, reached across disciplines and schools to collaborate on this technological innovation.

CAPGLO is expected to be very inexpensive to manufacture. ""If we can really do it, for a few hundred dollars rather than thousands or hundreds of thousands, that's where this treatment reaches equity,"" said Brown, a Distinguished University Professor and Institute Professor of physics.

As co-leader of the Immune Oncology Program, Wald directs the Case CCC clinical Cell Therapy Lab that manufactures CAR T cell therapies for patients. He has developed an ultra-fast procedure to establish and expand CAR T cells in less than 24 hours.

T cells are extracted from a cancer patient's blood using ""leukapheresis,"" where blood is removed and centrifuged to harvest immune cells and then returned to the patient. This requires specialized equipment, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, as well as removing and replacing a large volume of blood.

The cells are then transformed into cancer killers in the lab by adding a protein called a chimericantigenreceptor, or CAR. These cells-now called CAR T cells-are multiplied in the lab and reinfused into the patient's bloodstream within a few days to weeks. The CAR protein acts like a navigation system to help track down and kill cancer cells. For some patients with even very advanced cancers, CAR T cell therapy can eradicate their disease.

CAPGLO wouldn't require more than about a half-pint of a patient's blood-the amount typically needed when donating blood.

This isn't Brown's first foray into the physics of blood. He and Case Western Reserve senior research associate Robert Deissler developed a technique to diagnose malaria that relies on the fact that malaria-infected blood carries extra iron-as iron-containing crystals, which are magnetic. This simple diagnostic tool using magnets to detect malaria in blood samples earned them a Patent for Humanity in 2016 from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, an award recognizing innovators for game-changing technology that meets global humanitarian challenges.

For this new project, the researchers make the T cells magnetic. Kathleen Molyneaux, a senior research associate in Brady-Kalnay's lab, coats tiny magnetic beads with a protein designed to snag T cells in a blood sample and bind them to the bead's surface.

Then, using CAPGLO and a magnetic field, Brown and Deissler can separate the magnetized T cells from the red blood cells and plasma, collecting the T cells in a small tube.

As a final step, the investigators plan to harmlessly snip off the beads, leaving a population of T cells ready for chimeric transduction in Wald's lab. The goal is to take and process a patient's blood within an hour, so the T cells don't become damaged.

The researchers received a grant from the CWRU Technology Validation and Startup Fund, a program supported by the Ohio Third Frontier, to explore the viability of the technology."
Medicine,"A new material developed at Cornell University could significantly improve the delivery and effectiveness of mRNA vaccines by replacing a commonly used ingredient that may trigger unwanted immune responses in some people.

Thanks to their ability to train cells to produce virus-killing proteins, mRNA vaccines have gained popularity over the last five years for their success in reducing the severity of COVID-19 infection. One method for delivering the mRNA to cells is by packaging it inside fatty spheres, called lipid nanoparticles, that protect it from being degraded. However, a common component of lipid nanoparticles called poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) can provoke immune responses in some individuals, leading researchers to search for more biocompatible materials.

Shaoyi Jiang, professor of biomedical engineering, is working to replace the PEG component of lipid nanoparticles with a more adaptable and stealthy option. The research is under embargo until 5am EST on May 29, 2025 in the journalNature Materials.

The delivery vehicle for an mRNA vaccine needs to strike a Goldilocks balance – stable enough to protect the mRNA, yet labile enough to release it inside cells, and shielded enough to evade immune surveillance, but not so hidden that it hinders cellular uptake. PEG does the job but presents some unintended side effects in a small subset of individuals.

This environment makes adverse responses to a vaccine more likely and thus makes it harder for the vaccine to do its job.

Most people's immune systems are already primed to fight PEG. Prior research shows that a majority of people have anti-PEG antibodies ""from people being exposed to PEG in so many commercial products like shampoo and toothpaste,"" said Jiang, adding that this widespread exposure may explain why the body is so quick to flag PEG as a threat.

To solve this, Jiang has developed lipid nanoparticles that use a zwitterionic polymer, a crucial alternative to PEG, enhancing the performance and biocompatibility of the system. Due to the super-hydrophilic, or water-loving, nature of zwitterions, this material is able to blend into the body and deliver the mRNA more easily. This specific naturally derived material, called poly(carboxybetaine) (PCB), has perfect balance of stealth and stability. In his recent paper, Jiang found that replacing PEG with PCB in lipid nanoparticle results in highly effective mRNA vaccines that do not adversely trigger the body's immune system.

Jiang is working with Weill Cornell Medicine, Houston Methodist Cancer Center, the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and the National Cancer Institute to move this discovery toward clinical applications, specifically in the development of mRNA-based cancer vaccines. The zwitterionic nanoparticles help sneak the vaccines past the body's immune surveillance so that it inducesantigen-specific immune responses while minimizing undesired immune activation.

""With a virus like COVID-19, you only need a tiny vaccine dose, and our immune system will respond. But for a cancer vaccine, the tumor environment suppresses the immune system, so you need a much higher dose to be effective,"" said Jiang. ""If a patient has a minor problem because of the PEG, the issue will be amplified with a higher dose.

The research was supported in part by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the National Cancer Institute, both part of the National Institutes of Health."
Medicine,"Nanomedicines, especially those based on nanoparticles, are revolutionizing healthcare in terms of both diagnostics and therapeutics. These particles, often containing metals like iron or gold, can serve as contrast agents in medical imaging, act as nutritional supplements, and even function as carriers for drug delivery. Thanks to their unique properties plus careful engineering, nanomedicines can reach and accumulate in places within the body that conventional medicines cannot, making them promising for cancer detection and treatment. However, the same characteristics that make nanomedicines valuable also present challenges in ensuring their safety and quality.

Current pharmaceutical guidelines, including those from the International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), have a significant blind spot: they evaluate only the total amount of elements present in a medication without distinguishing between their different forms, such as ions or differently sized particles. This distinction is crucial because these different forms can have different effects on the body, including varying toxicity profiles.

Against this backdrop, a research team led by Assistant Professor Yu-ki Tanaka from the Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Chiba University, Japan, has developed a new analytical method to address the existing regulatory gap. Their study, which was made available online in the journalTalantaon April 8, 2025, introduces a technique to separately quantify ions, nanoparticles, and aggregated particles in nanomedicines. Co-authored by Yasumitsu Ogra and Sana Hasegawa, also from Chiba University, the study showcases how this method can improve quality control for these advanced pharmaceutical products. ""By incorporating a novel evaluation method that addresses a previously overlooked issue in current evaluation guidelines, we can ensure the safe use of metal-based nanomedicines such as Resovist® and Ferinject®"" explains Dr. Tanaka.

The researchers combined two existing technologies-asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). They used the AF4 method in a novel way, taking advantage of its initial 'focus step.' During this step, particles are held inside the AF4 channel by two opposing flows. Using a special permeable membrane, cross-flows filter out the tiniest dissolved particles (ions), enabling quantification based on the differences in ICP-MS signals between samples with and without ion removal−namely, with and without the focus step. Once the ions are separated, the system then uses AF4's standard separation process to sort the retained nanoparticles by size. Finally, the ICP-MS device attached to the output can determine the approximate number of nanoparticles of each size. This combination enabled the team to distinguish between free metal ions, small hydroxide colloids, and nanoparticles of various sizes, all containing the same metal element.

They tested their approach on Resovist®, a nanomedicine used as a contrast agent in liver magnetic resonance imaging scans. The analysis revealed that only 0.022% of the iron in Resovist®was present in ionic form. At approximately 6.3 micrograms per milliliter, this negligible amount falls well below levels of concern. Additionally, the team confirmed that the active nanoparticles were smaller than 30 nanometers in diameter, with some aggregates around 50 nanometers. Importantly, no large aggregates were detected, which could reduce the effectiveness of the contrast agent. These results confirm both the safety and stability of Resovist®as a nanomedicine.

The proposed technique is particularly relevant for emerging cancer treatments that use gold nanoparticles as drug delivery systems or metallic particles for photothermal therapy. These advanced treatments rely on the 'enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect,' by which nanoparticles leak from blood vessels around tumors and accumulate in cancerous tissue. ""Since many novel nanomedicines consist of metal-based nanoparticles as their active ingredients, providing reliable methods for evaluating their safety and quality control will promote their development and clinical use,"" notes Dr. Tanaka.

Additionally, this novel analytical approach extends beyond pharmaceuticals. It can also assess the safety of metal nanoparticles in food additives, cosmetics, and environmental samples-helping to ensure public health across multiple sectors. The researchers showcased its versatility by successfully analyzing both negatively charged ions (silicon) and positively charged ions (iron), indicating its potential for a wide range of nanomaterials.

Overall, by offering a more comprehensive assessment of the composition, quality, and stability of nanoparticles, this research paves the way for safer and more effective nanomedicines and nanoparticle-based technologies."
Medicine,"Researchers have uncovered that some childhood cancers have a substantially higher number of DNA changes than previously thought, changing the way we view children's tumors and possibly opening up new or repurposed treatment options.

Concentrating on a type of childhood kidney cancer, known as Wilms tumor, an international team genetically sequenced multiple tumors at a resolution that was previously not possible. This collaboration included researchers at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, University of Cambridge, Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, the Oncode Institute in the Netherlands, Great Ormond Street Hospital, and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

They uncovered many more genetic changes per cancer cell than expected, adding up to millions of changes per tumor. This suggests that some childhood tumors could be eligible for treatments such asimmunotherapy.

In the study, published today (29 May) inNature Communications, the team also describes a single, spontaneous genetic change that causes a rare type of Wilms tumor, which children are born with, and that this change happens early during development in the womb. They found that these tumors have a particular appearance under the microscope and genetic profile, implying that it could be possible, in the future, to develop personalised therapeutics and tailor clinical plans for those with this genetic change.

This research challenges the widely held notion that childhood cancers have a very low number of genetic changes and instead suggests that there could be effective adult treatments that could be adapted for childhood tumors in the future.

Wilms tumor is a type of kidney cancer that largely affects children under the age of five. In the UK, about 85 children are diagnosed with Wilms tumor every year.

Previously, it was thought that childhood cancer tumors, like those in Wilms tumor, had a low number of genetic changes, also called genetic variants.

To investigate how and why these tumors present so early in life, the team at the Sanger Institute and their collaborators applied the latest genomic sequencing techniques to understand more about how and when these genetic changes occurred.

Bulk whole genome sequencing methods allow researchers to find genetic changes that are shared by all the cells in the tumor. While this can work well for adult tumors, as the cells have had more time to develop, childhood tumors have fewer shared genetic changes, meaning that the large number of mutations that are not shared by all cells are missed.

To overcome this, the team used two cutting-edge techniques: nanorate sequencing, otherwise known as nanoseq, and whole-genome sequencing of single-cell-derived organoids to study kidney tumors at much higher resolution. These methods allow scientists to find genetic changes that might be present in just a single cell of a cancer.

The team used these methods to genetically sequence Wilms tumor samples from four children, aged up to six months. They found that a single cancer cell had an additional 72 to 111 genetic changes on top of the ones already identified via bulk whole genome sequencing methods. This means that when the overall number of cells in the tumor is taken into consideration, there are most likely millions of genetic changes per tumor overall, not the low numbers that were previously thought.

Alongside changing our understanding of childhood tumors, this new finding could also have implications for treatment. The researchers suggest that with this number of possible genetic changes, it's likely that tumors could become resistant to treatments quicker, or that some drugs might not work at all.

However, this discovery could also mean that childhood tumors are better candidates for existing treatments that are currently used for adult tumors, such as immunotherapies.

The team also traced the evolution of the tumors in three children and uncovered a newmutationthat causes Wilms tumor. This single change in theFOXR2gene was found to happen while the kidney was developing in the womb, and is associated with a particular appearance of the tumor under the microscope and a specific set of RNA changes. Researchers suggest that this could be used to identify these tumors and that, one day, it may be possible to develop specific personalised treatment for certain genetic profiles in Wilms tumor.

Dr. Jarno Drost, co-senior author at the Princess Máxima Center for Pediatric Oncology and the Oncode Institute in the Netherlands, said: ""Being able to trace the evolution of a tumor can uncover crucial information about how and why it develops. In this study, we uncovered a single genetic change that occurred during development and caused this subset of Wilms tumor. Treatment for Wilms tumor has to carefully balance treating the tumor and lowering the risk of recurrence, while minimising the impact this can have on a young child's quality of life and their family. By understanding the genetic changes that cause tumors, and in this case, identifying different genetic subsets, it could lead to more targeted treatment options, something that every child deserves.""

Professor Sam Behjati, co-senior author at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""It has been a widely held belief that childhood tumors had much lower numbers of genetic changes than adult tumors. However, thanks to the development of new genomic sequencing tools, we have been able to show that, at least in these cases, it is not true. Our findings suggest that childhood tumors have at least four times more genetic changes per cell than expected, which adds millions more changes per tumor, highlighting that what we could see before was just the tip of the iceberg. This has implications for both childhood kidney cancer and possibly other childhood tumors. If we understand childhood cancer fully, we can develop new ways to treat it or repurpose existing treatments to get options to those who need them as quickly as possible."""
Medicine,"Health nonprofits and medical interpreters warn that federal cuts have eliminated dozens of positions in California for community workers who help non-English speakers sign up for insurance coverage and navigate the health care system.

At the same time, people with limited English proficiency have scaled back their requests for language services, which health care advocates attribute in part to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown and his executive order declaring English as the national language.

Such policy and funding changes could leave some without lifesaving care, particularly children and seniors. ""People are going to have a hard time accessing benefits they're entitled to and need to live independently,"" said Carol Wong, a senior rights attorney for Justice in Aging, a national advocacy group.

Nearly 69 million people in the U.S. speak a language other than English, and 26 million of them speak English less than ""very well,"" according to the most recent U.S. Census data available, from 2023. A KFF-Los Angeles Times survey from that year found that immigrants with limited English proficiency reported more barriers accessing health care and worse health than English-proficient immigrants.

Health advocates fear that, without adequate support, millions of people in the U.S. with limited English proficiency will be more likely to experience medical errors, misdiagnosis, neglect, and other adverse outcomes. During the start of the pandemic in 2020, ProPublica reported that a woman with coronavirus symptoms died in Brooklyn after missing out on timely treatment because emergency room staffers could not communicate with her in Hungarian. And, at the height of the crisis, The Virginian-Pilot first reported that a Spanish translation on a state website erroneously stated that the covid-19 vaccine was not necessary.

In 2000, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order aimed at improving access to federal services for people with limited English proficiency. Research shows language assistance results in higher patient satisfaction, as well as fewer medical errors, misdiagnoses, and adverse health outcomes. Language services also save the health care system money by reducing hospital stays and readmissions.

Trump's order repealed Clinton's directive and left it up to each federal agency to decide whether to maintain or adopt a new language policy. Some have already scaled back: The Department of Homeland Security and the Social Security Administration reportedly reduced language services, and the Justice Department says it is reviewing guidance materials. A link to its language plan is broken.

It's unclear what the Department of Health and Human Services intends to do. HHS did not respond to questions from KFF Health News.

An HHS plan implemented under President Joe Biden, including guidance during public health emergencies and disasters, has been archived, meaning it may not reflect current policies. However, HHS's Office for Civil Rights still informs patients of their right to language assistance services when they pick up a prescription, apply for a health insurance plan, or visit a doctor.

And the office added protections in July that prohibit health providers from using untrained staff, family members, or children to provide interpretation during medical visits. It also required that translation of sensitive information using artificial intelligence be reviewed by a qualified human translator for accuracy.

Those safeguards could be undone by the Trump administration, said Mara Youdelman, a managing director at the National Health Law Program, a national legal and health policy advocacy organization. ""There's a process that needs to be followed,"" she said, about making changes with public input. ""I would strongly urge them to consider the dire consequences when people don't have effective communication.""

Even if the federal government ultimately doesn't offer language services for the public, Youdelman said, hospitals and health providers are required to provide language assistance at no charge to patients.

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race or national origin, protections that extend to language. And the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which expanded health coverage for millions of Americans and adopted numerous consumer protections, requires health providers receiving federal funds to make language services, including translation and interpretation, available.

""English can be the official language and people still have a right to get language services when they go to access health care,"" Youdelman said. ""Nothing in the executive order changed the actual law.""

Insurers still need to include multi-language taglines in their correspondence to enrollees explaining how they can access language services. And health facilities must post visible notices informing patients about language assistance services and guarantee certified and qualified interpreters.

State and local governments could broaden their own language access requirements. A few states have taken such actions in recent years, and California state lawmakers are considering a bill that would establish a language access director, mandate human review of AI translations, and improve surveys assessing language needs.

""With increasing uncertainty at the federal level, state and local access laws and policies are even more consequential,"" said Jake Hofstetter, policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.

The Los Angeles Department of Public Health and San Francisco's Office of Civic Engagement and Immigrants Affairs said their language services have not been affected by Trump's executive order or federal funding cuts.

Demand, however, has dropped. Aurora Pedro of Comunidades Indígenas en Liderazgo, one of the few medical interpreters in Los Angeles who speaks Akatek and Qʼanjobʼal, Mayan languages from Guatemala, said she has received fewer calls for her services since Trump took office.

And other pockets of California have reduced language services because of the federal funding cuts.

Hernán Treviño, a spokesperson for the Fresno County Department of Public Health, said the county cut the number of community health workers by more than half, from 49 to 20 positions. That reduced the availability of on-the-ground navigators who speak Spanish, Hmong, or Indigenous languages from Latin America and help immigrants enroll in health plans and schedule routine screenings.

Treviño said staffers are still available to support residents in Spanish, Hmong, Lao, and Punjabi at county offices. A free phone line is also available to help residents access services in their preferred language.

Mary Anne Foo, executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander Community Alliance, said the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration froze $394,000 left in a two-year contract to improve mental health services. As a result, the alliance is planning to let go 27 of its 62 bilingual therapists, psychiatrists, and case managers. The organization serves more than 80,000 patients who speak over 20 languages.

""We can only keep them through June 30,"" Foo said. ""We're still trying to figure it out — if we can cover people.""

Medicine,"In early April, President Donald Trump gathered dozens of hard-hat-clad coal miners around him in the White House East Room. He joked about arm-wrestling them and announced he was signing executive orders to boost coal production, ""bringing back an industry that was abandoned,"" and to ""put the miners back to work.""

Trump said he calls it ""beautiful, clean"" coal. ""I tell my people never use the word 'coal' unless you put 'beautiful, clean' before it.""

That same day, the Trump administration paused implementation of a rule that would help protect coal miners from an aggressive form of black lung disease. Enforcement of the new protections is officially halted until at least mid-August, according to a federal announcement that came a few days after a federal court agreed to put enforcement on hold to hear an industry challenge. But even if the rule takes full force after the delay, the federal agency tasked with enforcing it in Appalachia and elsewhere may not be up to the task after sweeping layoffs and office closures.

Deaths from black lung — a chronic condition caused by inhaling coal dust — had been in decline since the introduction of federal regulations over a half-century ago. But in recent decades, cases have risen precipitously. By 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the lungs of about 1 in 5 coal miners in central Appalachia showed evidence of black lung. It is being diagnosed in younger miners. And the deadliest form, progressive massive fibrosis, has increased tenfold among long-term miners.

Silica is the primary culprit. Exposure to it has increased since mining operations began cutting through more sandstone to reach deeper coal deposits. The stone breaks into sharp particles that, when airborne, can become trapped in lung tissue and cause a debilitating, sometimes fatal condition.

The new rule was set to take effect in April, cutting the allowable level of silica dust in the air inside mines by half — to the limit already in place for other industries — and set stricter guidelines for enforcement.

Years in the making, advocates for miners heralded the new standards as a breakthrough. ""It is unconscionable that our nation's miners have worked without adequate protection from silica dust despite it being a known health hazard for decades,"" acting Labor Secretary Julie Su said when the rule was announced last spring under the Biden administration.

The rule pause came on top of another blow to mine safety oversight. In March, the Department of Government Efficiency, created by a Trump executive order, announced it would end leases for as many as three dozen field offices of the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration, with the future of those employees undetermined. That agency is responsible for enforcing mining safety laws.

Then in April, two-thirds — nearly 900 — of the workers at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, were fired. As a result, NIOSH's Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program, which offered miners free screenings from a mobile clinic, ceased operations.

An announcement by MSHA of the silica rule delay cited the ""unforeseen NIOSH restructuring and other technical reasons"" as catalysts for the pause but didn't mention the federal court decision in the case seeking to rescind the rule.

Separately, on May 7, attorney Sam Petsonk filed a class-action lawsuit against Health and Human Services and its head, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to reinstate the program. His client in the case, Harry Wiley, a West Virginia coal miner, was diagnosed with an early stage of black lung and applied to NIOSH for a transfer to an environment with less dust exposure but never received a response. He continues to work underground.

On May 13, U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction to reinstate the surveillance program employees. The next day, Kennedy said the administration would reverse the firings of 328 NIOSH employees. That day, they were back at work.

""Remaining in a dusty job may reduce the years in which Mr. Wiley can walk and breathe unassisted, in addition to hastening his death,"" Berger wrote. ""It is difficult to imagine a clearer case of irreparable harm.""

MSHA officials declined to respond to specific questions about the silica rule or plans to implement and enforce it, citing the ongoing litigation.

In an emailed statement, Labor Department spokesperson Courtney Parella said, ""The Mine Safety and Health Administration is confident it can enforce all regulations under its purview. MSHA inspectors continue to conduct legally required inspections and remain focused on MSHA's core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for U.S. miners.""

Wes Addington is quick to say a career in the mines isn't necessarily a death sentence. He comes from generations of miners. One of his great-grandfathers worked 48 years underground and died at 88.

But Addington also said protecting the safety and health of miners requires diligence. He's executive director of the Appalachian Citizens' Law Center, a Whitesburg, Kentucky, nonprofit that represents and advocates for miners and their families. A study the center conducted found that staffers at the MSHA offices scheduled to close performed almost 17,000 health and safety inspections from January 2024 through February 2025.

Addington said NIOSH provided the data to document worsening conditions over the past few decades.

Addington's organization has advocated for the new silica rule for 17 years. ""We didn’t think it was perfect,"" he said. He would have preferred lower exposure limits and more stringent monitoring requirements. ""But, as it was, it was going to save lives.""

The cuts to the agency, Addington said, could affect every American worker who might be exposed to harmful elements in the workplace. NIOSH approves respirators prescribed by Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations.

With fewer inspectors, miners are ""more likely to get hurt on the job and those injuries could be fatal,"" he said.

""And if you're a miner that's lucky enough to navigate that gantlet and make it through a 20-, 25-year career,"" Addington said, ""the likelihood that you develop disabling lung disease that ultimately kills you at an early age is much increased.""

The black lung clinic at Stone Mountain Health Services in southwestern Virginia has diagnosed 75 new cases of progressive massive fibrosis in the past year, according to its medical director, Drew Harris.

""People are dying from a dust-related disease that's 100% preventable, and we're not using all the things we could use to help prevent their disease and save their lives,"" Harris said. ""It's just all very disheartening.""

He believes it would be a mistake for Kennedy to reorganize NIOSH as he has proposed, shifting the surveillance program team's responsibilities to other employees.

""It's a very unique expertise,"" Harris said. The agency would be ""losing the people that know how to do this well and that have been doing this for decades.""

Rex Fields first went to work in the mines in 1967, a year before an explosion killed 78 miners near the small town of Farmington, West Virginia. His wife, Tilda Fields, was aware of the hazards her husband would encounter — the safety issues, the long-term health concerns. Her dad died of black lung when she was 7. But it meant a well-paying job in a region that has forever offered precious few.

Rex, 77, now lives with an advanced stage of black lung disease. He's still able to mow his lawn but is easily winded when walking uphill. It took him several weeks and two rounds of antibiotics to recover from a bout with bronchitis in March.

Throughout his career, Rex advocated for his fellow miners: He stepped in when he saw someone mistreated; he once tried, unsuccessfully, to help a unionization effort. For these efforts, he said, ""I got transferred from the day shift to the third shift a time or two.""

Today, the Fieldses lobby on behalf of miners and share information about occupational dangers. Tilda organized a support group for families and widows. She worries about the next generation. Two of the Fieldses' sons also went into mining.

""People in the mountains here, we learn to make do,"" Tilda said. ""But you want better. You want better for your kids than what we had, and you surely want their safety.""

Medicine,"On Christmas Day at the WaTiki indoor water park, Hans Wirt was getting winded from following his son up the stairs to the waterslides.

Wirt's breathing became more labored once they returned to the nearby hotel where they and Wirt's girlfriend were staying while visiting family in Rapid City, South Dakota.

Then he grew nauseated and went pale. Wirt thought the cause might have been the altitude change between his home in Deltona, Florida — 33 feet above sea level — and Rapid City, at the edge of the Black Hills. But his 12-year-old son was worried and called for an ambulance.

""I could tell by the look in his eyes that there was something a little more to this,"" Wirt said. ""So I can kind of thank my son for saving my life.""

It turned out the 62-year-old was having a heart attack. A ""lousy Christmas present,"" Wirt said.

Medics stabilized Wirt before taking him to Monument Health — the only hospital in Rapid City with an emergency room — where he was treated over two days.

Then the bill came.

The Medical Procedure

Paramedics used a defibrillator to restore a normal heart rhythm. Doctors at the hospital gave Wirt various medications, used an electrocardiograph and other diagnostic and monitoring devices, and inserted stents into his arteries to improve blood flow to his heart.

The Final Bill

$95,523.73, including $32,998.90 for medical supplies, mostly related to the stents, and $28,879 for treatment in a cardiac catheterization lab. After unspecified hospital adjustments to the bill, Wirt owed $77,574.44.

The Billing Problem: Medicaid Across State Lines

Wirt is covered by Florida's Medicaid program through Sunshine Health, a managed-care plan. But the South Dakota hospital refused to submit the bill to his out-of-state Medicaid plan, instead sending it to Wirt and eventually threatening to send the debt to a collection agency.

Medicaid, the government health insurance program primarily for low-income people and those with disabilities, is jointly funded by the federal government and states. States are responsible for administering Medicaid, and most contract with private insurance companies like Sunshine Health.

Federal law says state Medicaid programs must reimburse out-of-state hospitals for beneficiaries' care in an emergency.

Many hospitals bill out-of-state Medicaid plans in such situations. If they don't, they risk not being reimbursed at all, since Medicaid recipients probably won't be able to afford large bills, said Katy DeBriere, who was legal director for the Florida Health Justice Project when she spoke with KFF Health News in April.

But there's no federal law that requires them to do so, she said.

Federal court opinions have noted that hospitals are not required to bill Medicaid for every individual beneficiary they treat, even if they generally accept Medicaid.

Monument Health didn't bill Wirt's insurance because the hospital isn't enrolled as a health care provider with Florida Medicaid, said hospital spokesperson Stephany Chalberg. She told KFF Health News that Monument bills Medicaid plans only in South Dakota and four bordering states: Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, and Minnesota.

The hospital's website says Medicaid patients who are not enrolled in one of those states ""are responsible for any charges.""

""Due to the significant credentialing requirements of our multiple hospitals and hundreds of physicians we do not participate with all states,"" a hospital representative wrote in a message to Wirt.

According to Florida's Medicaid website, out-of-state providers who have treated one of its enrollees must submit five documents to bill the program, including a six-page application, a copy of the provider's license, and a claim form.

The process is different in each state, and many Medicaid programs reimburse out-of-state providers at lower rates than those that are in-state, according to the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission, a federal agency that advises Congress.

Provider enrollment barriers leave ""beneficiaries in an untenable situation, preventing them from accessing the coverage to which they are legally entitled,"" Chalberg said.

Wirt decided to submit his bill to his Medicaid plan on his own. But he said Sunshine Health told him it can only process bills received directly from providers.

Elizabeth Boyd, a spokesperson for Sunshine Health, told KFF Health News that its staff contacted the hospital on Wirt's behalf. She did not respond when asked why the plan can't process bills submitted by patients or what more it could have done to help Wirt.

The Resolution

A few days after KFF Health News emailed officials at Monument Health for this story, Wirt noticed his balance due fell from more than $77,000 to $0.

Chalberg told KFF Health News that Monument Health covered Wirt's bill through its charity care program. She said that ""appropriate patients"" are told about the program and that ""before any bill is sent to collections, it is evaluated to determine whether the patient may qualify for our financial assistance policy.""

To retain tax-exempt status, nonprofit hospitals must have programs that provide free or discounted care to patients who can't afford their bills.

But Wirt said that when he first contacted Monument Health after receiving his bill and said he couldn't afford to pay it, officials didn't mention the program. He said they didn't share any resources when he asked whether there were outside groups that could help him pay the bill. Wirt said hospital officials just recommended setting up a payment plan, but the monthly bills were still too high for him to afford. ""There's a reason why I'm on Medicaid,"" Wirt said. ""It's just beyond me how they can expect somebody who had Medicaid to come up with that kind of money. It's unrealistic.""

The Takeaway

Sarah Somers, legal director at the National Health Law Program, said the various ""cogs in the Medicaid system"" didn't operate correctly in Wirt's situation. ""Nobody's exerting themselves enough to just smooth the way for this person.""

States are responsible for managing Medicaid and are therefore the main ""cog,"" Somers said. She said Medicaid managed-care companies are also supposed to intervene.

Somers and DeBriere said Medicaid recipients who receive bills they don't think they owe should file a complaint with their state's Medicaid program and, if they have one, their managed-care plan. They can also ask whether there is a Medicaid or managed-care caseworker who can advocate on their behalf.

The attorneys said patients should also contact a legal aid clinic or a consumer protection firm that specializes in medical debt. DeBriere said those organizations can help file complaints and communicate with the hospital.

DeBriere said that, had she assisted Wirt, she would have immediately sent a letter to Monument Health ordering it to stop billing him and to either register with Florida Medicaid to submit his bill or offer him charity care.

Wirt said the doctors who treated him and the medical care he received at Monument Health were excellent. He said he spoke out about the hospital's billing practices because he doesn't want others to endure the same experience.

""If I get sick and have a heart attack, I have to be sure that I do that here in Florida now instead of some other state,"" he joked.

Medicine,"Jack:I’m Jack, one of the co-founders of Unicorn Biotechnologies. My background is in chemistry, and I’ve worked across academia, industry, and startups. I really enjoy working at the intersection of science and engineering—turning lab-based science into real-world solutions. Adam and I met during the pandemic on Zoom, and we actually started the company before ever meeting in person.

Adam:I did my PhD in cancer research over 15 years ago, then moved into stem cell research and tissue engineering. After a stint in big industry, I realized innovation thrives more in startups. I got into hardware engineering because I couldn’t believe how much of cell culture was still manual. That’s where Unicorn came in—we’re trying to automate those laborious processes and bring reproducibility to cell culture, which has been a challenge for decades.

Adam:There are two true stories. First, unicorn companies are startups valued over a billion dollars, so it’s a cheeky goal. Second, we had 15 minutes to register a company name and found Unicorn Biotechnologies was available. Also, the unicorn is the national animal of Scotland, where I’m from, and my son—who helped with our early lab work during lockdown—loved the name. He still calls it “Daddy’s company” every time he sees a unicorn in a store.

Jack:Automating cell culture isn’t a new idea, but previous systems have three major drawbacks—they’re huge, expensive, and not always reproducible. Some are the size of multiple Volkswagens and cost seven figures. They're also typically built from repurposed lab automation hardware, which leads to variability. With Emmet, we built a purpose-designed system that integrates everything into a compact benchtop device. It’s more reproducible, more affordable, and more accessible for everyday labs.

Adam:Our software is designed with scientists in mind. Many companies bolt on software at the end, but for us, the software and hardware were co-designed. Users can input their standard operating procedures—like seeding, passaging, or differentiating cells—and customize fluid flow, rocking frequency, and other parameters. Setup is super intuitive, like using a capsule-based espresso machine. In the future, we want Emmet to incorporate feedback loops and real-time decision-making, removing the variability of human input altogether.

Jack:Emmet is modular and flexible both internally and externally. Internally, users can change hardware and software settings quickly. For example, switching from six to twelve T-flasks can be done in minutes. Externally, the system fits on any standard lab bench. To scale, labs can simply add more Emmet units without having to reengineer their process, making tech transfer and scaling much simpler.

Adam:We prioritize quality control and reproducibility. We use onboard imaging and sensing systems for pH, glucose, and lactate. We're also developing biochemical fingerprinting tools. Instead of subjective decisions like “it looks 80% confluent,” we generate real data to guide actions. This standardizes processes and reduces the artisan-like variability that still exists in many labs.

Jack:All of the above. Most labs, even high-tech ones, still do cell culture manually. We validated Emmet with sensitive pluripotent stem cells, and if it can handle those, it can handle almost any mammalian cell line—from iPSCs to cancer cell lines to HEK cells for viral vector production.

Adam:Absolutely. We already use imaging and machine learning to monitor confluence and identify cell types. The next step is predictive analytics—giving Emmet a target outcome and letting it figure out the protocol. We’re experimenting with LLMs like ChatGPT to design experiments automatically. It’s like building a discovery engine.

Jack:(laughs) Just to clarify—we’re not in a partnership with OpenAI… but we’d love to be!

Jack:It was amazing. From the moment the exhibition opened to the minute it closed, we had constant interest. Most of it was organic—people saw our talk or were drawn in by our stuffed unicorns—and we had deep, meaningful conversations with folks who really need what we’re offering.

Jack:Yes, we had great conversations with people in our ideal customer profile—scientists dealing with manual cell culture issues who want a better solution. They see real business value in Emmet—less FTE time, better consistency, and fewer delays due to human scheduling.

Jack:The best part? Definitely the stuffed unicorns! But seriously, in-person conversations are invaluable. We learned more and had more productive commercial interactions in two days at SLAS than we would from months of email outreach. It’s that spontaneous hallway magic—you can’t beat it.

Jack:We’re scaling up deployments—already in the UK, with US and EU expansions coming soon. Beyond Emmet, we have other R&D products in the pipeline, including GMP-ready versions and smaller-scale systems for early discovery.

Adam:We want Emmet systems to be as common as PCR machines—helping researchers across cancer, stem cells, vaccines, and beyond. It’s about creating an outsized impact across all of science.

Medicine,"Interactive robots should not just be passive companions, but active partners–like therapy horses who respond to human emotion–say University of Bristol researchers.

Equine-assisted interventions (EAIs) offer a powerful alternative to traditional talking therapies for patients with PTSD, trauma and autism, who struggle to express and regulate emotions through words alone.

The study, presented at the CHI '25: Proceedings of the 2025 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems held in Yokohama, recommends that therapeutic robots should also exhibit a level of autonomy, rather than one-dimensional displays of friendship and compliance.

In EAIs, individuals communicate with horses through body language and emotional energy. If someone is tense or unregulated, the horse resists their cues. When the individual becomes calm, clear, and confident, the horse responds positively. This 'living mirror' effect helps participants recognise and adjust their emotional states, improving both internal well-being and social interactions.

However, EAIs require highly trained horses and facilitators, making them expensive and inaccessible.

Ellen continued: ""We found that therapeutic robots should not be passive companions but active co-workers, like EAI horses.

""Just as horses respond only when a person is calm and emotionally regulated, therapeutic robots should resist engagement when users are stressed or unsettled. By requiring emotional regulation before responding, these robots could mirror the therapeutic effect of EAIs, rather than simply providing comfort.""

This approach has the potential to transform robotic therapy, helping users develop self-awareness and regulation skills, just as horses do in EAIs.

Beyond therapy, this concept could influence human-robot interaction in other fields, such as training robots for social skills development, emotional coaching, or even stress management in workplaces.

A key question is whether robots can truly replicate - or at least complement - the emotional depth of human-animal interactions. Future research must explore how robotic behaviour can foster trust, empathy, and fine tuning, ensuring these machines support emotional well-being in a meaningful way.

Ellen added: ""The next challenge is designing robots that can interpret human emotions and respond dynamically-just as horses do. This requires advances in emotional sensing, movement dynamics, and machine learning.

""We must also consider the ethical implications of replacing sentient animals with machines. Could a robot ever offer the same therapeutic value as a living horse? And if so, how do we ensure these interactions remain ethical, effective, and emotionally authentic?"""
Medicine,"How does where you live, by the ocean or an inland lake, shape your lifespan? Discover why coastal living adds years and why blue spaces don’t always mean better health.

Study:Unveiling Complexity in Blue Spaces and Life Expectancy. Image Credit: De Visu / Shutterstock

In a first-of-its-kind study published in the journalEnvironmental Research, researchers investigated the impact of proximity to coastal and inland water bodies on life expectancy in both urban and rural communities across the United States (US).

Did you know that where you live, especially how close you are to water, might impact how long you live? Life expectancy, a key indicator of overall well-being, is influenced by factors such as income, healthcare, and environmental conditions. While the benefits of green spaces are well-known, “blue spaces” like oceans, lakes, and rivers are gaining attention for their effects on both mental and physical health. Coastal areas often offer cooler temperatures, better air quality, and recreational benefits, while inland waters show mixed effects. Direct research on how these spaces affect life expectancy has been absent globally—a gap this pioneering study addresses.

Researchers studied 66,263 census tracts across the contiguous United States, using life expectancy data from 2010 to 2015 provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's US Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project. Blue space exposure was measured in two ways: proximity to coastal waters (within 0, 20, or 50 kilometers) and the presence of large inland water bodies (at least 10 or 20 square kilometers). Environmental data, including air pollution (PM₂.₅ and wildfire smoke), terrain features, temperature extremes, and drought susceptibility (as measured by the Standardized Precipitation Index), were collected from national sources. Socioeconomic data, including income and population demographics, were obtained from the American Community Survey.

Analytical approaches included multiple linear regression, multi-level models (to account for state-level variations), and spatial regression (addressing geographic clustering). A mutual information model was applied to identify key factors differentiating coastal and inland water-proximate tracts. Sensitivity analyses tested alternative definitions of blue space exposure. All analyses utilized specialized statistical software, with a particular focus on urban-rural differences.

Life expectancy in the US averaged 78.3 years across census tracts. Multi-level regression revealed that proximity to coastal waters (within 50 km) significantly increased life expectancy (β=0.32), while proximity to inland water bodies (≥20 km²) reduced it overall (β=-0.14). Critically, inland waters showed divergent effects: urban exposure decreased longevity (β=-0.39), but rural exposure increased it (β=0.22).

Mutual information analysis identified the most influential differences between coastal and inland tracts: coastal tracts had far fewer hot days (2.2 vs. 21.0 days annually), lower maximum temperatures (34.3°C vs. 37.7°C), higher barren land coverage (0.65% vs. 0.13%), and better air quality (annual smoke PM₂.₅: 0.52 µg/m³ vs. 0.78 µg/m³).

Coastal advantages included milder temperatures, fewer smoke days (30.6 vs. 40.3 annually), flatter terrain (road TRI count: 633.6 vs. 1,759.7), reduced drought susceptibility, and significantly higher incomes ($91,075 vs. $67,775). Urban-rural disparities emerged in other factors: Population density increased urban longevity (β=0.49) but decreased rural (β=-9.73), while elevation benefited only rural residents (β=0.62).

This groundbreaking research confirms that the impact of blue space on longevity is not universal. Living near coastal waters extends life expectancy through milder climates, cleaner air, recreational access, transportation advantages, and higher incomes. Meanwhile, inland waters exhibit location-dependent effects: they are harmful in urban areas due to pollution and flood risks, but beneficial in rural settings. These insights call for context-sensitive integration of blue spaces into public health planning. The authors acknowledge limitations, including the study's cross-sectional design and the lack of data on water quality and recreational use. Urban planners and policymakers can leverage these findings to design health-equitable communities and address spatial health disparities nationwide."
Medicine,"In a new study of college undergraduates in Japan, the students' self-perception of their own athletic ability was linked with several internal and external factors, such as personality traits, family characteristics, leisure activities, and others' perceptions. Sho Ito of Nanzan University, Japan, and colleagues present these findings in the open-access journalPLOS Oneon May 28, 2025.

Self-perception of one's own athletic ability could influence one's motivation to engage in physical activity. For young people, the sense of one's own athleticism may affect their participation in sports and other physical activities, which could, in turn, have implications for health and academic achievement.

However, while people often refer to others' ""athletic ability,"" this term's definition is vague. Furthermore, research on the underlying factors associated with self-perception of one's own athletic ability has been limited. To help clarify, Ito and colleagues investigated self-perception of athletic ability among 406 undergraduate students, who each completed a questionnaire evaluating their sense of their own physical capability across 11 different sports disciplines, such as soccer, volleyball, and basketball. The students also completed assessments of personality, family background, and history of physical activity.

Statistical analysis of the responses revealed that students who perceived themselves as having higher overall athletic ability tended to also score higher for the personality traits of grit, resilience, and a growth mindset. These students were also more likely to be youngest siblings, to be frequently called ""athletic"" by others, to have first walked at an earlier age, and to have more prior sports experience, athletic parents, and a higher parental household income. Meanwhile, they were less likely to engage in certain leisure activities, such as games and music.

These findings could help lead to a deeper understanding of factors influencing athletic ability, which could also help establish a more precise definition of the term. However, this study does not confirm any cause-effect relationships, and the authors note that additional research is needed to clarify how the factors identified in this study are related to development of self-perception of athletic ability.

The authors add: ""Our study shows that subjective perceptions of athletic ability are shaped not only by personality traits and sports experience, but also by early childhood environments and family background. We were particularly surprised to find that the youngest siblings reported higher perceived athletic ability-perhaps because they often imitate older siblings."""
Medicine,"Innovative fermentation methods reveal how pressed black cabbage, enriched with yeast or bacteria, delivers superior health benefits and flavor, opening new possibilities for functional foods.

Study: Innovative approaches for the fermentation of black cabbage with improved nutritional and health-promoting traits. Image Credit: Robyn-May / Shutterstock

In a recent article published in the journalLWT - Food Science and Technology, researchers investigated how controlled fermentation can improve the safety and nutritional value of black cabbage.

They found that fermentation significantly enhanced the antioxidant activity and polyphenol content of black cabbage, increased levels of health-supporting short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in yeast-fermented samples, introduced health-supporting compounds that varied with the starter used, and promoted the growth of beneficial gut bacteria, with all treatments boosting microbial abundance, but with only modest differences between unfermented and fermented samples in terms of overallmicrobiomeshifts.

The study also found that yeast fermentation was associated with greater increases in the neurotransmitter GABA, which has been linked to blood pressure regulation and anti-depressive effects.

This study is notable as one of the first to systematically compare both lactic acid bacteria and yeast starters for black cabbage fermentation.

Vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage are rich in beneficial compounds, including glucosinolates, flavonoids, and polyphenols, which have been linked to lower risks of chronic illnesses, including neurodegeneration, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.

However, how these vegetables are processed is key in improving and preserving their beneficial compounds. Fermentation is a widely used method that preserves food, enhances its sensory and nutritional qualities, and makes it safer to consume. In cabbage, natural fermentation is driven by the lactic acid bacteria present in the plant, but this may lead to safety concerns, and the consistency of the fermented product cannot be easily controlled.

Attention has turned to the use of specific starter cultures, such asLactiplantibacillus plantarum, to ensure improved, predictable, and consistent results. Studies have shown that starter-driven fermentation enhances the beneficial properties, polyphenol content, and antioxidant levels. However, the use of other starters, such as yeast, has not been explored. This study is the first to systematically compare the effects of both lactic acid bacteria and yeast starters for black cabbage fermentation.

Researchers applied controlled fermentation using selected bacteria and yeast starters to black cabbage to investigate how these treatments would affect its nutritional traits.

Fresh black cabbage leaves were sourced from a local Italian market before being washed and chopped into small pieces. The cabbage was then subjected to one of two fermentation methods, either immersion in a saltwater brine (80 g/L NaCl) or pressing the leaves with dry salt (40 g/kg) to release juices and start fermentation.

Two microbial strains were selected: the lactic acid bacteriumLactiplantibacillus plantarumTB 11-32 and the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiaeLI 180-7. These were cultured separately before being added to the cabbage to reach specific concentrations (~7 log CFU/g for bacteria, ~6 log CFU/g for yeast). The fermentation took place at room temperature in the dark for approximately 30 days. The mixture’s pH and salinity were monitored, and it was stirred every 10 days. Fermentation was considered complete if the pH was lower than 4.6.

After fermentation, samples were evaluated for microbial safety, chemical composition, and sensory traits. A sensory panel of 14 untrained participants assessed taste and texture using a scale from 0 (none) to 6 (intense). Samples were chewed and swallowed, with palate cleansing between tastings.

For microbial analysis, samples were diluted and cultured to assess the presence of beneficial microbes and check for harmful bacteria. Additionally, biochemical tests were done to measure changes in nutrients, polyphenols, and antioxidant activity using hydroalcoholic extracts from the fermented samples.

Fermentation of black cabbage using starter cultures (bacteria or yeast) significantly altered its chemical, sensory, and nutritional properties.

The pH dropped from 6.0 to around 4.0–4.1 by day 30, marking the end of fermentation, while salt levels stabilized at 70 g/L after 10 days in both brined and pressed samples. Pressed cabbage showed more texture loss, including softness and reduced fibrousness, but both preparations maintained food safety standards. Low levels of Enterobacteriaceae (~3 log CFU/g) were detected but were controlled by salt concentration and starter competition.

Starter cultures influenced taste and biochemical changes. Pressed cabbage fermented with yeast had lower bitterness and higher sweetness and umami than untreated samples. The organic acid content varied: lactic acid was highest in the bacterial samples, while the yeast-fermented samples showed more acetic acid.

Pressed samples also had higher counts of microbial lactic acid bacteria, supporting greater fermentation activity. Yeast growth was most pronounced in the yeast starter sample, while all treatments remained free of major pathogens.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity increased in all samples, with the yeast-fermented cabbage showing the largest gains: phenolic content rose 4.6 times, and antioxidant activity increased 3.4 times compared to unfermented cabbage. Fermentation enhanced the release of bioactive compounds from plant tissues. This effect was particularly marked in the pressed, yeast-fermented cabbage, while brined samples showed smaller increases.

LAB-fermented samples, on the other hand, showed increases in released phenolic compounds, which have potential cardiovascular health benefits.

Free amino acid content increased notably for both starters, especially for essential and bioactive amino acids. However, the yeast-fermented cabbage showed the highest overall increase, demonstrating a significant nutritional enhancement through fermentation. Specifically, the concentration of GABA (γ‑aminobutyric acid), a neurotransmitter associated with hypotensive and neuroprotective effects, rose significantly with both bacteria and yeast fermentation.

Distinct aroma profiles were observed: yeast fermentation produced more diverse and fruitier esters, while LAB fermentation resulted in higher levels of sulfur and other aroma-active compounds.

In vitro digestion and faecal fermentation experiments showed that all black cabbage samples, whether fermented or not, increased the abundance of beneficial gut bacteria compared to untreated faecal slurry. However, the differences between unfermented and fermented cabbage were modest for some bacterial groups. Yeast-fermented samples specifically promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids and related esters, compounds with potential benefits for gut health and irritable bowel syndrome, while LAB-fermented samples led to increased release of phenolic compounds that may help reduce oxidative stress and support cardiovascular health.

This study confirms that starter-driven fermentation can improve the safety, taste, and nutritional quality of black cabbage.

Both bacteria and yeast effectively reduced pH, enriched flavor, and enhanced the content of health-promoting compounds, including phenolics, antioxidants, and amino acids. Pressing cabbage before fermentation helped release more nutrients and improved microbial growth, particularly for beneficial bacteria and yeasts.

Using yeast showed the strongest improvements in taste, including lower bitterness and higher umami, as well as increased polyphenol content, antioxidant activity, and amino acid levels, suggesting that yeast starters can be highly effective. However, the study found that pressing with either good starter culture (LAB or yeast) offered optimal results, and both approaches showed distinct functional advantages. The findings suggest that fermentation using selected starters serves as a sustainable bio-preservation technique, producing a shelf-stable product without wastewater or by-products. Industrial-scale-up trials (processing over 300 kg batches) are underway, and a clinical trial is planned to further assess health impacts in humans.

These changes align with previous studies on sauerkraut and fermented vegetables, emphasizing the importance of fermentation methods and microbial strain selection.

Notably, no harmful microbes were found in any fermented product, demonstrating the safety of the process. All products met food safety standards, and the fermentation protocol offers environmental benefits by minimizing waste and allowing for year-round production.

Overall, pressed black cabbage fermented with yeast or LAB emerged as especially promising methods for developing flavorful and functionally enriched fermented vegetables, with yeast showing particular strength in sensory and nutritional enhancement, but both approaches contributing important health benefits."
Medicine,"New research reveals that sleep disorders can signal future risk of Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and other dementias years before symptoms appear, offering hope for early intervention and prevention.

Study:Sleep disturbances as risk factors for neurodegeneration later in life. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock

In a recent study published in the journalnpj Dementia, researchers investigated the neurodegenerative impacts of clinically identified sleep disorders and related disturbances in later life. They mined biobank data of more than 1 million participants across Finland, Wales, and the United Kingdom (UK). Study findings revealed a significant association between these sleep disorders and several neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD).

Notably, sleep disruptions were able to predict NDD risk as early as 5-15 years before disease diagnosis. For Alzheimer's Disease, this risk appeared largely independent of genetic predisposition, while for Parkinson's Disease, an interaction with genetic factors was observed. These findings highlight the long-term impacts of conditions like sleep apnea and other formally identified sleep disorders, underscoring the importance of sleep interventions in preserving late-life neurological health.

Sleep is a nearly universal, fundamental biological process essential for optimal cognitive function and overall health. Several studies have established strong, bi-directional relationships between sleep and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), demonstrating that certain sleep disorders and significant sleep disturbances can trigger both short-term cognitive impairment and exacerbate long-term dementia risk.

Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasized the importance of sleep as a critical health behavior, advocating for research and interventions to address sleep disorders and enhance sleep quality across various human populations. Unfortunately, sleep disturbances are a common and growing global health concern, with reports estimating that 25% of all Europeans have insomnia.

Furthermore, despite research elucidating several genetic and environmental contributors to sleep disruptions, the mechanisms underpinning sleep's role in NDD etiology remain poorly understood. The extent to which specific, clinically recognized sleep disorders can predict NDD risk remains similarly inconclusive. Most studies investigating sleep-NDD associations have limited sample sizes, insufficient follow-up durations, and focus on one of a few NDDs, thereby complicating attempts to establish these outcomes.

The present study aims to further investigate the associations, and potential causal links, between sleep and NDDs by leveraging an extensive medical electronic health records (EHRs) database comprising more than 1 million individuals across Finland, Wales, and the United Kingdom (UK), analyzing EHR data from a 20-year period (1999-2018), drawing from broader records. Study data were obtained from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank, the FinnGen datasets, and theUK Biobank(UKB).

Participants' NDD and sleep disorder diagnoses were classified using International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes (e.g., G30 for Alzheimer's disease and G47.3 for sleep apnea), ensuring that the study focused on clinically documented conditions rather than self-reported symptoms. Cohort-specific medical histories were further used for statistical modeling and meta-analyses, including the computation of Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs), polygenic risk scores (PRSs), and logistic regression models.

To isolate the behavioral impacts of sleep (exposure) on NDD, models were controlled for participants' genetic predisposition, age, sex, and other confounding variables. To facilitate the generalizability of results and improve the accuracy of outcomes, all analyses were replicated across multiple populations.

Regression and HR analyses revealed strong relationships between ICD-10 coded sleep disorders and a spectrum of late-life NDDs. Circadian rhythm-associated sleep disorders (ICD10 code G47, which include conditions like insomnia, narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and parasomnias,) were demonstrated as substantial risk factors in the subsequent development of Alzheimer's disease (AD; HR = 1.15), Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia, and vascular dementia (HR = 1.41).

Non-organic sleep disorders (ICD10 code F51, such as nightmares and generalized insomnia not due to substances) were similarly associated with increased dementia (HR = 1.67), PD, and vascular dementia (HR = 2.05) risk. The study also found that the severity of certain sleep disorders, indicated by recurrent clinical diagnoses, tended to increase risk for some NDDs. While sleep apnea was demonstrated to be associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a lack of sufficient ALS data prevented the generalizability of these results.

Notably, many identified associations persisted even after adjusting for genetic risk factors. Specifically, for Alzheimer's Disease, the contributions of diagnosed sleep disorders to neurodegeneration risk appeared largely independent of genetic factors. However, for Parkinson's Disease, the study found evidence of an interaction between genetic risk and certain sleep disorders.

Individuals with a low genetic predisposition to NDDs still demonstrated high NDD HRs associated with these sleep conditions, suggesting that such disorders are significant risk factors, particularly impactful in those with lower genetic susceptibility.

All identified associations were observed to precede NDD diagnoses by between 5 and 15 years, suggesting sleep evaluations as an early indicator of future NDD risk. These findings highlight the potential of sleep interventions in mitigating late-life neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs), underscoring the importance of early detection and management of sleep disorders to enhance overall neurological well-being.

The present study utilizes the largest-scale sleep dataset to date to elucidate the relationships between clinically documented sleep disorders and late-life NDD risk. It analyzed EHR data from a 20-year period, drawing from broader records from more than 1 million participants, and found clear associations between such sleep disorders and late-life NDDs. These associations often persisted after adjusting for participants' genetic predispositions for conditions like Alzheimer's, though interactions with genetic risk were noted for Parkinson's Disease.

While utilizing a predominantly European cohort and exclusive EHR (as opposed to blood assays) data prevents the global generalizability of these findings, this study presents an ideal first step in non-invasively combating late-life neurodegeneration.

Notably, formally identified sleep disorders were found to be accurate and stable predictors of future neurodegeneration risk, suggesting the assessment of such disorders as both an early indicator of AD, PD, dementia, and vascular dementia, but also highlighting their treatment as a modifiable and treatable avenue to healthy neurological aging."
Medicine,"In a first-of-its-kind genome-wide association study (GWAS) researchers have discovered two genes,RNF144BandENPP1, that cause calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease in Americans of European and African descent. This crystalline arthritis is caused by calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal deposition in joints. The findings of this novel study in theAnnals of the Rheumatic Diseases, published by Elsevier, open up promising new avenues for targeted prevention and treatment of CPPD disease, which are currently lacking.

Characterized by the deposition of CPP crystals in articular tissues, CPPD disease is a heterogeneous crystalline arthritis that can cause acute or chronic joint symptoms and is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis in individuals over 60 years of age. In Europe and North America, the prevalence of imaging evidence of CPPD disease is estimated to be about 10% in middle-aged adults, depending on articular location, with prevalence increasing to approximately 30% in adults over 80 years of age. CPPD disease is also associated with cartilage degradation and osteoarthritis, although it remains unclear whether CPPD disease is a cause or consequence of these conditions.

Acute CPP crystal arthritis, historically called ""pseudogout,"" is the most widely recognized form of CPPD disease. It results from CPP crystals in the joint activating pro-inflammatory pathways, leading to IL-1b secretion and causing acute inflammatory arthritis. Chondrocalcinosis, a radiographic finding that is most often due to CPPD, is common in older adults and doubles in prevalence with each decade beyond age 60.

The current research entailed a GWAS in which all genes in the human genome were simultaneously assessed for association with CPPD disease. The study was carried out in the Million Veterans Program, comprising more than 550,000 Veterans (91% male) of African and European genetic ancestry drawn from the US Veterans Health Administration. The main finding was the identification of two genes,RNF144BandENPP1, that cause CPPD disease in Americans. Importantly, the same genes were detected in both people of European ancestry and African ancestry.

Lead investigator Tony R. Merriman, PhD, Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University of Alabama at Birmingham; Birmingham Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System; and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Otago (Dunedin, New Zealand), says,""The most significant result of our research was the discovery of one of the genes,ENPP1. The protein encoded by this gene controls the production of chemicals (adenosine monophosphate and inorganic pyrophosphate) that, together with calcium ions, lead to the formation of the CPP crystals.""

Co-investigator Sara K. Tedeschi, MD, MPH, Division of Rheumatology,Inflammationand Immunity, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, adds,""The genome-wide association withENPP1is particularly exciting to me as a rheumatologist because it makes sense:ENPP1generates inorganic pyrophosphate, one of the components of CPP crystals. Patients with CPPD disease are desperate for an effective treatment, and trials testingENPP1inhibitors in CPPD disease would be of great interest.""

Little is known about the other gene,RNF144B, aside from that it is possibly involved in inflammation. More is known aboutENPP1and, of potential importance to people with CPPD disease, drugs targeting the protein have been developed in the treatment of infectious disease and cancer that could be evaluated for the treatment of CPPD disease.

Josef Smolen, MD, Medical University of Vienna (Austria), and Editor-in-Chief of theAnnals of the Rheumatic Diseases, comments,""There is a considerable unmet need for treatment of CPPD disease, which commonly focuses on the alleviation of inflammation, most often with non-steroidalanti-inflammatorydrugscolchicine or prednisone. This first GWAS study in CPPD disease points to two targets for future treatment, which is crucial given the current lack of options for patients.""

Dr. Merriman concludes,""We are thrilled about the potential impact of what we have uncovered in our research and the possibility of new drugs being developed for the treatment of CPPD disease. The findings of this study produced a 'eureka moment,' which can be rare in a scientist's career."""
Medicine,"In order to truly decolonize the field of global health, it may be necessary for institutions from the Global North to practice ""ruinous solidarity,"" according to a study published May 21, 2025 in the open-access journalPLOS Global Public Healthby Daniel Krugman from Brown University, United States, and Alice Bayingana from the University of Sydney, Australia.

Even as scholarship related to decolonizing global health advances, global health institutions from the Global North still largely dominate the field via a ""soft money"" structure (funded by repeatedly winning grants from donors). This financial dominancy in turn bolsters the ideological power of these Northern institutions in the global health field. Here, Krugman and Bayingana describe ideological and financial structures at a major school of public health in the United States to better understand their makeup and influence.

The authors interviewed 30 faculty members from a school of public health (which remains anonymous to protect their confidentiality). Though most participants supported the overall idea of shifting power to institutions based in the Global South, they expressed contradictory feelings about how that shift would be operationalized. This was primarily present in discussions focused on funding for global health programs and research, as a shift away from funding institutions based in higher-income countries would threaten the researchers' own livelihoods and possibilities for career advancement. The ""soft money"" systems that fuel most universities' research departments, in which researchers compete for limited grants to fund their own salaries in addition to the research being conducted, reinforces the current entrenched system. Most of the faculty using grants to cover their salary participated in multiple projects adding up to a full salary, with one tenured professor describing themself and other scholars as ""…this person who goes out and hunts for grants. If you get them, you survive. And if you don't, you don't."" Many faculty described this situation as distracting from the goal of impacting the partner countries they worked with and causing burnout. Others noted how when grant donors changed priorities around countries they were willing to support, this forced them to shutter projects or let down long-term partners due to a lack of funding. However, when discussing hypothetically removing this soft power grant structure and shifting funding directly to the Global South, most participants also expressed anxiety about how this would negatively impact their own livelihoods.

Krugman and Bayingana suggest that for transformation of the global health field to succeed, Northern researchers and institutions must be willing to accept the possibility of losing substantial institutional and personal resources (""ruinous solidarity""), particularly now when science funding in the United States is being cut.

The authors add: ""Our qualitative anthropological and linguistic study reveals how inequity in global public health research is reproduced by the 'soft-money' financial structures common across North American schools of public health. Through our interviews with global health faculty at one of these top institutions, we found how having to chase and procure outside grants not only causes them high stress and dismay that their research has less impact than it should, but also blocks changes they want to see. Because American universities need the overhead of soft money grants to stay financially afloat, the incentive to truly redistribute power and opportunity to Global South partners is antithetical to their bottom line. In conversations about decolonizing global health that have grown over the past decade, material systems, not just symbolic power, must be centered. Without real action on the part of elite Northern global health actors to demand their institutions to restructure their financial system--an act that may hurt their jobs and livelihoods--power will stubbornly reproduce through the continued dominance of Northern-grant winning to fund their jobs and their institutions."""
Medicine,"How do we think, feel, remember, or move? These processes involve synaptic transmission, in which chemical signals are transmitted between nerve cells using molecular containers called vesicles. Now, researchers have successfully modeled the vesicle cycle in unprecedented detail, revealing new information about the way our brain functions.

A joint study, published inScience Advances, between researchers at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST), Japan, and the University Medical Center Göttingen (UMG), Germany, has applied a unique computational modeling system, which considers the complicated interplay of vesicles, their cellular environments, activities and interactions, to create a realistic picture of how vesicles support synaptic transmission. Their model predicts parameters of synaptic function that could not be tested experimentally in the past, opening new avenues in neuroscience investigations.

""We have been working on synapses for over 20 years, but some functional steps were difficult to test experimentally. After several years of fine-tuning experimental and computational work with our Japanese colleagues, we now have a model for testing new hypotheses, especially in the context of neurological diseases"", added Professor Silvio Rizzoli, director of the Department for Neuro- and Sensory Physiology at the UMG and also co-author on the study.

The vesicle cycle describes the steps through which neurotransmitters (chemical signals) are released at a synapse (a junction between nerve cells), to transfer information between cells. Vesicles containing neurotransmitters move and dock at the membrane, ready to fuse and release their contents, before being recycled. The process is prompted by electrical stimulation within the brain and is driven by a complex signaling cascade.

Depending on the situation, different amounts of neurotransmitters need to be released over different time periods. To enable controlled and sustained synaptic transmission, only 10-20% of vesicles are readily available to dock at any given time (these are known as the recycling pool). Most vesicles are instead in a reserve pool, immobilized in a cluster.

Many details of this process, including how vesicles move between the reserve and recycling pool, were poorly known.

In their publication, the researchers shed new light on the vesicle recycling process in hippocampal synapses. With their model, they aimed to both confirm the behavior of vesicles at experimentally-observed firing frequencies, and explore behavior at higher frequencies.

They discovered that the vesicle cycle was able to operate at high stimulation frequencies, far beyond what is normally found in nature. They were also able to pinpoint some of the reasons behind this robust cycle, identifying the roles of key proteins synapsin-1 and tomosyn-1 in regulating vesicle release from the clustered reserve pool.

The researchers noted that the efficiency of the vesicle cycle relied on molecular tethering. By physically connecting some vesicles to the membrane with tethers, a close supply of vesicles could be made available for rapid docking and neurotransmitter release.

These important findings enable deeper understanding of vesicle recycling, a process involved in many different diseases. ""For example, the release of neurotransmitters is hampered in botulism or some myasthenic syndromes. Treatments for depression and other major neurological diseases also often focus on synaptic transmission,"" explained Prof. De Schutter. ""As we expand our models, the potential applications are vast, both in developing new therapeutics, and in deepening our fundamental understanding of how the brain works."""
Medicine,"A first-of-its-kind clinical trial clinical trial shows that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) combined with intravenous immunoglobin reduced biological age on average by 2.6 years, as measured by multi-omic biomarkers. Results of the single-blind, placebo-controlled trial are published in the May 28, 2025, issue ofAging Cell, providing early data on the impact of TPE on biological age, supporting its potential for new disease and longevity applications.The research was led by scientists at Circulate Health, a company dedicated to harnessing the potential of TPE to advance human healthspan and lifespan, and the Buck Institute for Research on Aging.

Therapeutic plasma exchange is a procedure that separates, removes, and replaces patient plasma to treat certain diseases. The study,investigated how TPE impacts biomarkers associated with biological age, including changes across the epigenome, proteome, metabolome, glycome, and immune system, alongside physical measures like balance and strength. Research participants were assigned one of four different treatment groups: 1) biweekly TPE, 2) biweekly TPE with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 3) monthly TPE or 4) a control group.

The study found:

""This is the first interventional multi-omics study to examine the effectiveness of therapeutic plasma exchange modalities,"" said Brad Younggren, MD, CEO and Co-founder of Circulate. ""Our findings show that plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin are a powerful tool for biological age rejuvenation and provide compelling evidence that targeted plasma interventions can impact age-related molecular changes.""

""In this study, we examined thousands of molecular signatures to pinpoint key drivers of rejuvenation. Our characterization builds a better understanding of which baseline biomarkers are predictive of treatment response and lays a foundation upon which we can build personalized intervention plans for patients in the future,"" said Eric Verdin, MD, President and CEO of the Buck Institute and Co-founder of Circulate. ""We are excited to expand our research to larger populations, increase access to these treatments for eligible patients, and continue to identify areas of unmet need where these therapies can make a meaningful difference."""
Medicine,"Parkinson's disease is best known for its effects on the central nervous system. In addition, recent scientific advances generally emphasize the role of the immune system in the presence and development of the disease.

In a study published today inBrain, researchers led by Université de Montréal associate professor of neuroscience Martine Tétreault show that some cell types in the immune system are activated more in patients who have Parkinson's.

""Thanks to a new technology called single-cell RNA-seq, we can differentiate the cellular subtypes and observe gene expression at the cellular level for each cell,"" explained Tétreault, a research scientist at the CRCHUM, Université de Montréal's affiliated hospital research centre.

""We found that in Parkinson's patients, immune cells in the blood were activated and overexpressed genes associated with stress responses,"" she said. ""Together, these biomarkers form the signature of the disease.""

Tétreault conducted the study with three co-first authors: Gaël Moquin-Beaubry, a former postdoctoral fellow in her lab, and current PhD candidates Lovatiana Andriamboavonjy and Sébastien Audet.

Noting the current lack of clinical biomarkers needed to diagnose Parkinson's, the researchers believe that knowing the disease's unique signature could help clinical teams diagnose it early on, from a blood sample.

The set of biomarkers could also make it easier to distinguish the disease from other similar rare diseases, especially Parkinsonian syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and multiple system atrophy (MSA).

In their study, the research team analyzed blood samples from 14 CHUM patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Parkinson's and six patients presenting with Parkinsonian syndromes, comparing them with a control group of 10 healthy people.

Her research team is now making available to other scientists a complete atlas of immune system cellular subtypes found in healthy individuals and people with Parkinson's.

In 2024, approximately 110,000 Canadians were living with Parkinson's disease. By 2034, that number is expected to grow to around 150,000."
Medicine,"Inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, has long been considered a modern condition of the industrialized West, with cases steadily increasing in North America and Europe throughout the 20thcentury. New research conducted by an international consortium shows that IBD and related conditions are now spreading through developing regions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America as well.

The study, published inNature, used data from more than 500 population-based studies covering more than 80 geographic regions to describe a pattern of four distinct stages IBD progresses through as it first appears in a region and spreads through the population. In describing these stages, the researchers hope to provide resources and guidance to local health care systems for coping with the growing burden of patients with IBD.

The research was conducted by the Global IBD Visualization of Epidemiology Studies in the 21st Century (GIVES 21) consortium, a group of international IBD and public health experts led by Gilaad G. Kaplan, MD, from the University of Calgary and Siew C. Ng, MBBS, PhD, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. GIVES21 has built a large repository of IBD epidemiology data and offers open access to the complete dataset for researchers, clinicians, and patients worldwide through a web application.

""This has been a huge, collaborative effort to understand IBD around the globe,"" said GIVES21 team member David T. Rubin, MD, the Joseph B. Kirsner Professor of Medicine at the University of Chicago.

""Now that we recognize what's happening with IBD in emerging areas of the world, we can start focusing on being able to treat it in places where these conditions are new. We can also study it in these emerging areas so we might get new clues as to what's driving this so we can help prevent it,"" said Rubin, who is also the newly elected Chair of the International Organization for the study of IBD (IOIBD), which supported the new study.

The team drew on a century's worth of data about IBD compiled by GIVES21. They analyzed new diagnoses per year and total people living with IBD, and found that it is unfolding in four distinct, predictable stages:

As a chronic inflammatory condition that is driven by immune system responses, IBD has been linked to so-called Western diets that are high in processed foods, animal products, and sugar while also low in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. People in industrializing economies tend to adopt more elements of this diet, but that alone doesn't tell the full story; IBD is increasing in India, for example, which has a high proportion of people who are vegetarian.

Rubin said other factors may be contributing as well. Growing evidence points to the implications of how food is prepared and stored, as more researchers explore the effects of emulsifiers and microplastics in food on IBD. He also emphasizes that it's important to remember that IBD is really dozens of distinct different conditions caused by myriad genetic and environmental factors.

As Director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center at UChicago, Rubin hopes to bring some of these same insights home on a smaller scale. He and his colleagues are planning to launch their own epidemiological study in Chicago to understand how different socioeconomic factors and access to care affect the largely Black and Latino patient populations on the south and southwest sides of the city who often have more severe versions of the disease.

""Even though we have one of the largest IBD centers in the world, there's a clear disparity in diagnosis and access to expert care just a mile from here,"" he said. ""Taking something like this at a global level and getting down to the microcosm of the South Side of Chicago is incredibly important to find better ways to diagnose, treat, and eventually prevent IBD our own patients."""
