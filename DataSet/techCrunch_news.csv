Technical,"Elon Muskmay have stepped awayfrom his duties as the lead of theDepartment of Government Efficiencyand adviser to President Trump, but he’s still active in D.C. circles. This time, he’s on the other side, lobbying lawmakers on legislation related to autonomous vehicles, according to areport by Bloombergthat cited unnamed sources.

Musk and others in his orbit have been calling members of Congress directly, according to Bloomberg. His efforts appear to be directed at a bill introduced May 15 called theAutonomous Vehicle Acceleration Act.

Musk has bet much of Tesla’s future on AI, robotics, and autonomous vehicles. He has frequently tied the company’s value to its investment and eventual commercialization of autonomous vehicles. And next month, Tesla is expected to launch a small andgeofenced robotaxi servicein Austin, Texas. Tesla also wants to eventually roll out autonomous vehicles — branded Cybercabs — that don’t have a steering wheel or pedals. But today there are not clear federal rules or standards to allow such a vehicle to operate at scale."
Technical,"Elon Musk’s X experienced an outage on Friday, according to user reports and crowdsourced data from sites likeDowndetector. From what TechCrunch staff has witnessed firsthand, the X website and app still loaded, but various features were not functioning properly, and entire feeds — like X’s algorithmic For You feed — didn’t load any content.

Others reported thatphotos weren’t loading,X’sbanking service XMoneywasn’t working, the timeline was bare, posts weren’t publishing, and search wasn’t returning results, among other things.

Based on the timing of the user reports, the outage and errors seem to have begun just before 4 p.m. ET on Friday and seem to be resolving as of the time of writing.

During the outage,thousands of users submitted reports to Downdetector,and others more directly complained in X posts and on other social networks, like Bluesky and Threads.

This was the second outage for X in just over a week, as the service also failedon May 22,when X experienced a number of issues over a 24-hour period. During that time, messages wouldn’t load, timelines wouldn’t update, and some posts couldn’t be seen without refreshing the webpage.

The current outage may be short-lived. We noticed that some features seemed to either be intermittently working, or worked on X’s mobile app but not on the desktop, for instance. Then, people began reporting that the service seemed to have come back up.

The X Developer API v2 is stillshowingdegraded status, however.

Just ahead of the outage, X beganrolling out its new DM feature, XChat, into beta afterpausing encrypted DMsas it worked to make improvements. It’s not clear if any of these changes impacted X’s stability, and the company no longer responds to press inquiries since Musk took ownership."

It might have been a short week, but there was still plenty of news, including anotherZooxrecall, an update on theStellantis-Amazonpartnership, and a few startup-funding deals.

One item of note: This week, I wrote aboutCarma Technologyand itspatent infringement lawsuitagainstUber. This isn’t a patent troll situation, and the IP attorneys I have spoken with say it will be a challenging case for Uber.

The gist? Carma, which was formed in 2007 by serial entrepreneur and SOSV Ventures founder Sean O’Sullivan, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against Uber, alleging the company infringed on five of its patents that are related to the system of matching riders (or packages) with capacity in vehicles. In other words, ride-sharing.

IP attorney Larry Ashery provided the money quote that explains why this is such a complicated and challenging case.

“What’s important to understand here is, Carma isn’t just asserting five patents. They have had a very sophisticated strategy of patent procurement that they’ve been working on for the past 18 years.”Carma’s five patents are part of a 30-patent family that are all related and connected to the original filing date. That matters because each of the five asserted patents contains multiple patent claims, which define the legal boundaries of the invention. These individual claims — not just the patents as a whole — are what Carma is asserting against Uber.

That means Uber will have to address and defend against each asserted claim, making the litigation more complex and difficult to defeat, Ashery noted.

Let’s get into the rest of the news.

A few little birds have been chirping at us for months now about a new autonomous vehicle technology startup that has been quietly plugging along for a year. The interesting nugget about this startup — which is calledBedrock Robotics— is who is behind it:Boris Sofman, who ledWaymo’s self-driving trucks program and previously co-founded and led the popular consumer robotics companyAnki.

The San Francisco-based startup is still in stealth, but my sources tell me it has raised considerable venture funds. Bedrock Robotics is working on a self-driving kit that retrofits onto construction equipment and other heavy machinery,according to a filingwith the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

Zooxissued itssecond voluntary softwarerecall in a month, following a collision between one of its robotaxis and an e-scooter rider in San Francisco on May 8. The incident is notable, largely for what happened after the unoccupied Zoox vehicle operating at low speed was struck by the e-scooter after braking to yield at an intersection.

According to Zoox, the e-scooterist fell to the ground directly next to the vehicle and the “robotaxi began to move and stopped after completing the turn, but did not make further contact with the e-scooterist.”

In other Zoox news, the company announced it was the “official robotaxi partner of Resorts World Las Vegas.” As part of the deal, there will be a dedicated and Zoox-branded robotaxi pickup and drop-off location at Resorts World Las Vegas.

Technical,"The chief executive of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP) says Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency left the nonprofit’s Washington, D.C., headquarters in disarray, full of water damage, rats, and roaches, according toa new sworn statementfirst reported byCourt Watch.

The statement from the executive, George Moose, comes just a few days after a federal judgeruledthat DOGE’s takeover of the nonprofit was illegal. And this week, Musk has claimed he is stepping away from DOGE, although he and President Trump have said he will continue to advise the administration.

DOGEstarted its takeoverof USIP in mid-March after a standoff that saw the nonprofit call the police on Musk’s government workers. Moose said at the time that DOGE staff had “broken into” the USIP headquarters in Washington, despite the fact that the nonprofit is not part of the executive branch and isn’t subject to the White House’s whims.

“It was very clear that there was a desire on the part of the administration to dismantle a lot of what we call foreign assistance, and we are part of that family,” Moose said at the time, referencing the Trump administration’s and DOGE’s dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development.

Moose initiallysaidthe nonprofit’s headquarters appeared to be in decent shape at a press conference on May 21, where he discussed the judge’s ruling. But one day later, according to the statement, members of Moose’s staff spent a day surveying the building and documenting the problems they found.

Moose wrote in his statement that, ahead of the judge’s ruling, the headquarters had been “essentially abandoned for many weeks” before USIP regained control. He said that DOGE had failed to “maintain and secure the building,” including “evidence of rats and roaches.”

“Vermin were not a problem prior to March 17, 2025, when USIP was actively using and maintaining the building,” Moose wrote.

Staff also reported to Moose that the building’s vehicle barriers were poorly maintained and that they spotted water leaks and “missing ceiling tiles in multiple places in the building (which I have been told suggest likely water damage).”

Now Moose said USIP has “engaged a private security firm to guard the building and premises” and “taken over responsibility for the building’s maintenance.”"
Technical,"If the adoption of AI feels different from any tech revolution you may have experienced before — mobile, social, cloud computing — it actually is.

Venture capitalist Mary Meeker just droppeda 340-page slideshow report— which used the word “unprecedented” on 51 of those pages — to describe the speed at which AI is being developed, adopted, spent on, and used, backed up with chart after chart.

“The pace and scope of change related to the artificial intelligence technology evolution is indeed unprecedented, as supported by the data,” she writes in the report, called “Trends — Artificial Intelligence.”

There’s a certain poetic history to this person writing this kind of report. Meeker is the founder and general partner at VC firm Bond and was onceknown as Queen of the Internetfor her previous annual Internet Trends reports. Before founding Bond, she ran Kleiner Perkins’ growth practice, from 2010-2019, where she backed companies like Facebook, Spotify, Ring, and Block (then Square).

She hasn’t released a trends report since 2019. But she dusted off her skills to document, in laser detail, how AI adoption has outpaced any other tech in human history.

ChatGPTreaching800 million users in 17 months: unprecedented. The number of companies andthe rate at which so many othersare hitting high annual recurring revenue rates: also unprecedented.

The speed at which costs of usage are dropping: unprecedented. While the costs of training a model (also unprecedented) is up to $1 billion, inference costs — for example, those paying to use the tech — has already dropped 99% over two years, when calculating cost per 1 million tokens, she writes, citing researchfrom Stanford.

The pace at whichcompetitors are matching each other’s features, at a fraction of the cost, including open source options, particularly Chinese models: unprecedented. For example, she points out that Nvidia’s 2024 Blackwell GPU uses 105,000x less energy per token than the company’s 2014 Kepler GPU predecessor.

Meanwhile, chips from Google, like its TPU (tensor processing unit), andAmazon’s Trainium, are being developed at scale for their clouds — that’s moving quickly, too. “These aren’t side projects — they’re foundational bets,” she writes.

The one area where AI hasn’t outpaced every other tech revolution is in financial returns. WhileVCs are pouring moneyon the AI fire as fast as they can, AI companies and cloud service providers are also burning through cash. AI requires massive investments in infrastructure.

That’s good for consumers and enterprises, the beneficiaries of fast improvements, while competition lowers costs, Meeker points out. But the jury is still out over which of the current crop of companies will become long-term, profitable, next-generation tech giants. “Only time will tell which side of the money-making equation the current AI aspirants will land,” she writes.

As for the rest of us: Just hold on to your hats."
Technical,"The Department of Energy announced today that it would be clawing back $3.7 billion worth of awards made under the Biden administration for clean energy and manufacturing. Large corporations and growing startups were caught up in the decision.

Energy secretary Chris Wright said the moves were “due diligence” on the part of the Trump administration. His statement did not cite specific reasons why the projects were canceled, but pointed to amemorandumhe issued on May 15, which suggests that the department may attempt to use its audit powers to rescind the awards.

In total, 24 projects are affected by the move, including ones being developed by oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, food manufacturer Kraft Heinz, industrial heat startup Skyven, cement and alumina startup Brimstone, and cement startup Sublime Systems.

Here’s a sampling of some of the awards in jeopardy:

Sublime told TechCrunch that it was caught off guard.

“Sublime was surprised and disappointed to receive the news about the termination of our Industrial Demonstrations Program award, given the clear progress we’ve made in scaling our American-invented technology, partnering with some of the Western World’s largest cement producers, and generating a bankable customer base,” spokesperson Rob Kreis said via email. The startup is evaluating its options to continue scaling up its operations.

Brimstone is hopeful that things can be resolved with the DOE.

“Given our project’s strong alignment with President Trump’s priority to increase U.S. production of critical minerals, we believe this was a misunderstanding. Brimstone’s Rock Refinery represents the only economically viable way to produce the critical mineral alumina in the U.S. from U.S.-mined rocks,” Brimstone spokesperson Liza Darwin told TechCrunch via email.

“As the first U.S.-based alumina plant in a generation, our project — which would also make portland cement — would clear a ‘mine-to-metal’ path for U.S. aluminum production, fortifying the U.S. critical mineral supply chain and creating thousands of jobs,” she added."
Technical,"WordPress.com parent company Automattic is changing direction… again.

Ina blog posttitled “Returning to Core” published Thursday evening, Automattic announced it will unpause its contributions to the WordPress project. This is despite having said only last monththat the 6.8 WordPress releasewould be the final major release for all of 2025.

“After pausing our contributions to regroup, rethink, and plan strategically, we’re ready to press play again and return fully to the WordPress project,” the new blog post states. “Expect to find our contributions across all of the greatest hits — WordPress Core, Gutenberg, Playground, Openverse, and WordPress.org. This return is a moment of excitement for us as it’s about continuing the mission we’ve always believed in: democratizing publishing for everyone, everywhere,” it reads.

Automattic says it’s learned a lot from the pause in terms of the many ways WordPress is used, and that it’s now committed to helping it “grow and thrive.”

The post also notes that WordPress today powers 43% of the web.

It’s unclear what has changed.

However, according to sources who spoke to TechCrunch, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg explained in an internal post published last night that he wants to get a 6.9 release out this year with an admin refresh and something from the “new AI team.” (The latter references this week’s announcement thatWordPress formed a new team to steward the development of AI projects.)

“I don’t think that will happen without our contributions,” the post stated, according to a source familiar with the internal discussions.

Insiders are speculating there’s more to it than that, and various theories are being floated. Some wonder if Mullenweg was pressured into this move or if he realized that pulling back wasn’t good for his business or its reputation? Others are debating if this change of heart has to do with Automattic’s ongoing litigation with WordPress’ hosting company, WP Engine, which Automattic has called a “threat” to the WordPress communityand a “cancer to WordPress.”

No one knows what to believe, and none of these backchannel theories line up with the officially stated reason.

Automattic was asked for additional comment.

Since 2024, Automattic has been engaged in a legal dispute that has to do with how little, in Mullenweg’s opinion, WP Engine contributes to the WordPress project, despite its size and revenue.

He sees the hosting company as profiting off the open source work WordPress is doing without giving back. Mullenweg also alleges that WP Engine benefits from the confusion between WordPress and commercial services like WP Engine. This led him to ban the company from accessing WordPress.org and sue in court forunauthorized trademark usage.

Simply put, Mullenweg thinks WP Engineshould either paya direct licensing fee or up its contributions to the open source WordPress project, or shouldn’t be allowed to use its trademark.

WP Enginerespondedthat it doesn’t think it needs a license and that Automattic misunderstands trademark law,suing Automattic in return.

Last month,Automattic laid off 16% of staff,saying the restructuring was necessary to be more agile and improve its productivity and profitability.

Technical,"A little-known patent infringement lawsuit could have big implications for Uber — and potentially dozens of other companies.

Carma Technology, a company formed in 2007 by serial entrepreneur andSOSVfounder Sean O’Sullivan, filed a lawsuit earlier this year against Uber alleging the company infringed on five of its patents that are related to the system of matching riders (or packages) with capacity in vehicles. In other words, ridesharing — a business Carma operated in some form for a decade until it changed its business model and applied its tech to road-pricing services like GPS tolling and HOV verification.

Carma has requested a jury trial and is seeking a permanent injunction against the company, mandatory future royalties on any Uber products that infringe on those patents as well as damages, and other costs related to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit, which has been quietly winding its way through the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, is relatively new. The allegations have been swirling for nearly a decade.

Carma lawyers first contacted Uber about its ridesharing and ground transportation patents in 2016, according to the complaint. That was an auspicious time for Uber. The startup, which was founded just seven years before, had shot into the stratosphere — in terms of valuation, growth, and gravitas.

Uber wasvalued at $66 billionat the time, and had a reputation for takingbig, legally sticky swingsinto new markets that helped it grow to hundreds of cities in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and the Middle East. It had raised more than $12.5 billion in venture capital, and was using it to launch new products and evenpush into autonomous vehicles.

Uber might have had the business model and the market share, but it didn’t have the specific ridesharing patents, O’Sullivan told TechCrunch in a recent interview. Carma does — plus acouple dozen others. Uber was allegedly aware of that fact as early as 2015 when the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office rejected one of its applications because it ran up against existing patents held by O’Sullivan and Carma, according to the lawsuit.

At least four of Uber’s patent applications — and in some cases numerous revisions to those patents — were rejected between 2016 and 2019 for the same reason. The rideshare giant would eventually abandon some of those applications.

Uber still holds hundreds of other patents covering a broad swath of technology and ideas that have been applied to its business.

O’Sullivan argues the core service of what Carma’s patents describe is exactly how the modern day ridesharing experience operates. And he contends that Uber is infringing on those patents even if the company’s business model operates more like a taxi business.

The case is a complicated one, intellectual property attorney Larry Ashery told TechCrunch. (Ashery is not involved in the case.)“What’s important to understand here is Carma isn’t just asserting five patents,” said Ashery, whose practice is based in the Greater Philadelphia area. “They have had a very sophisticated strategy of patent procurement that they’ve been working on for the past 18 years.”

He noted the five patents are part of a 30-patent family that are all related and connected to the original filing date. That matters because each of the five asserted patents contains multiple patent claims, which define the legal boundaries of the invention. These individual claims — not just the patents as a whole — are what Carma is asserting against Uber.

That means Uber will have to address and defend against each asserted claim, making the litigation more complex and difficult to defeat, he noted. Ashery said Uber’s strategy will likely be to try to invalidate these patents, which will be a challenge.

While Carma might have been armed with these specific patents, it took nine years for the company to actually sue Uber. Bunsow De Mory, a Redwood City-based law firm, is representing Carma in the case.

“When any business starts, it’s all about just actually capturing the market and winning in the marketplace,” O’Sullivan said. “Patents are meant to protect against aggressors from stealing the idea, but it’s not the main focus of your business to get patent revenue. It’s more as a protective mechanism.”

Carma, he said, has been “very busy building a multimillion-dollar business and getting to profitability.” But there are other reasons for that nine-year time gap, O’Sullivan explained. For one, the cost.

“It’s incredibly expensive to sue a large company over IP and Carma is a relatively small organization,” he said in a recent interview. “To come up with the $10 million-plus to take on a big patent suit, which is what it takes these days, is not a small task.”

O’Sullivan said the company did reach out to Uber as far back as 2016 “in the hopes that they would do the right thing and license our patents.”

“It really took us a while to come to terms with the idea that we actually had to sue Uber in order for them to respond,” he added.

Uber declined to comment on the lawsuit. Uber’s attorneys did make two procedural motions this week, including a sealed motion to dismiss for improper venue or alternatively to transfer venue for convenience. This procedural motion signals Uber’s desire for the case to be litigated in the Northern District of California, where it is based, rather than in Texas.

Notably, the lawsuit is aimed at Uber, not Lyft or other companies using ridesharing. O’Sullivan explained Carma is “going after the biggest player first” and noted that about 60 other companies are likely infringing on its patents.

The primary argument in the lawsuit ties back to five patents that have been granted to O’Sullivan and Carma, which was originally named Avego.

It all started with O’Sullivan’s frustration with traffic congestion, which ultimately led to thoughts about carpooling and how an automated system using smartphones could help people coordinate rides. That idea would turn into the startup Avego and become the basis of the first patent —No. 7,840,427.

The first patent, which O’Sullivan applied for in 2007 and was granted in 2010, created a shared transport system that matches empty space in a vehicle with riders or goods. The system established a set of pick-up and drop-off points and then matched users and drivers traveling along a similar route.

Before the patent was granted Avego’s ridesharing app debuted on Apple’s App Store in 2008, the same year the iPhone launched. Avego showed off its so-calledShared Transport appat the DEMO conference in 2008, which showed how a driver with an iPhone 3G could use the app to accept or reject a ride request. Once accepted, the rider was notified as the driver approached and then was prompted to enter a pin code to prove their identity and authorize an electronic payment.

Avego, which would later change its name to Carma, was focused on the promotion of ridesharing (as in carpooling) and not taxis, according to O’Sullivan. The company operated the carpooling business until October 2016, when the app was withdrawn from the App store. However, it still had other forms of ridesharing, like its partnership with Toyota, until phasing it out altogether in April 2018.

“If you look at the definition of ridesharing in federal legislation, it is carpooling,” O’Sullivan said, noting that Carma built up a multimillion-dollar ridesharing business in its early days.

When Uber and Lyft came in and tried to co-opt the term ridesharing to mean taxi-hailing it caused confusion in the market, prompting Carma to change its business model and apply its tech in new ways. “Uber and Lyft really took ridesharing in the direction of taxi services, but our company Carma didn’t want to,” O’Sullivan said.

Carma is still focused on reducing traffic congestion, but its tech is applied to a different business model.

Today, Carma uses its app to help transit authorities manage tolls and express lanes — a product line the company first rolled out in 2013. For instance, the app can be used by a driver on a toll road or even track vehicle occupancy for HOV lanes. The app is designed to get more riders into cars and reward those people by reducing tolls or giving drivers access to the HOV lane.

The idea, O’Sullivan said, is to offer toll authorities a way to reduce capital expenditure by up to 20 times by not using large gantry-based infrastructure systems. And it has paid off.

O’Sullivan says Carma is profitable, although pursuing this lawsuit will cut into its bottom line. Still, he said it’s worth the cost.

“I think there’s a danger in society where we can’t rely on our patents to protect the rights of the inventors, and the patent system exists specifically to protect the rights of investors, not to reward copycats that just happen to have deeper pockets,” he said, pointing to Uber’s attempts at its own patents and the rejection of them by the USPTO.

“We think it’s something that’s important to recognize that the rights of a relatively small inventor are being trampled upon. But it’s not just for Carma, really. We think of this as a problem for the entire system. It’s a test of whether the rule of law still applies when a powerful tech giant is involved.”"
Technical,"On May 6,WhatsApp scored a major victory against NSO Groupwhen a jury ordered the infamous spyware maker to pay more than $167 million in damages to the Meta-owned company.

The ruling concluded a legal battle spanning more than five years, which started in October 2019 whenWhatsApp accused NSO Groupof hacking more than 1,400 of its users by taking advantage of a vulnerability in the chat app’saudio-calling functionality.

The verdict came after a weeklong jury trial that featured several testimonies, including NSO Group’s CEO Yaron Shohat and WhatsApp employees who responded and investigated the incident.

Even before the trial began, the case had unearthed several revelations, including that NSO Grouphad cut off 10 of its government customersfor abusing its Pegasus spyware,the locations of 1,223 of the victimsof the spyware campaign, and the names of three of the spyware maker’s customers: Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Uzbekistan.

TechCrunch read more than 1,000 pages of court transcripts of the trial’s hearings. We have highlighted the most interesting facts and revelations below.

Thezero-click attack, which means the spyware required no interaction from the target, “worked by placing a fake WhatsApp phone call to the target,” as WhatsApp’s lawyer Antonio Perez said during the trial. The lawyer explained that NSO Group had built what it called the “WhatsApp Installation Server,” a special machine designed to send malicious messages across WhatsApp’s infrastructure mimicking real messages.

“Once received, those messages would trigger the user’s phone to reach out to a third server and download the Pegasus spyware. The only thing they needed to make this happen was the phone number,” said Perez.

NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli testified that “any zero-click solution whatsoever is a significant milestone for Pegasus.”

Following the spyware attack, WhatsApp filed its lawsuit against NSO Group in November 2019. Despite the active legal challenge, the spyware maker kept targeting the chat app’s users, according to NSO Group’s research and development vice president Tamir Gazneli.

Gazneli said that “Erised,” the codename for one of the versions of the WhatsApp zero-click vector, was in use from late 2019 up to May 2020. The other versions were called “Eden” and “Heaven,” and the three were collectively known as “Hummingbird.”

For years, NSO Group has claimed that its spyware cannot be used against American phone numbers, meaning any cell number that starts with the +1 country code.

In 2022,The New York Times first reportedthat the company did “attack” a U.S. phone but it was part of a test for the FBI.

NSO Group’s lawyer Joe Akrotirianakis confirmed this, saying the “single exception” to Pegasus not being able to target +1 numbers “was a specially configured version of Pegasus to be used in demonstration to potential U.S. government customers.”

The FBIreportedly chosenot to deploy Pegasus following its test.

NSO’s CEO Shohat explained that Pegasus’ user interface for its government customers does not provide an option to choose which hacking method or technique to use against the targets they are interested in, “because customers don’t care which vector they use, as long as they get the intelligence they need.”

In other words, it’s the Pegasus system in the backend that picks out which hacking technology, known as anexploit, to use each time the spyware targets an individual.

Shohat disclosed a small but notable detail: NSO Group and its parent company, Q Cyber, have a combined number of employees totaling between 350 and 380. Around 50 of these employees work for Q Cyber.

In a funny coincidence, NSO Group’sheadquartersin Herzliya, a suburb of Tel Aviv in Israel, is in the same buildingas Apple, whose iPhone customers are also frequently targeted by NSO’s Pegasus spyware. Shohat said NSO occupies the top five floors and Apple occupies the remainder of the 14-floor building.

“We share the same elevator when we go up,” Shohat said during testimony.

The fact that NSO Group’s headquarters are openly advertised is somewhat interesting on its own. Other companies that develop spyware or zero-days likethe Barcelona-based Variston, whichshuttered in February, was located in a co-working space while claiming on its official website to be located somewhere else.

During their testimony, an NSO Group employee revealed how much the company charged European customers to access its Pegasus spyware between 2018 and 2020, saying the “standard price” is $7 million, plus an additional $1 million or so for “covert vectors.”

These new details were included in a court document without the full context of the testimony, but offers an idea of how much advanced spyware like Pegasus can cost paying governments. While not explicitly defined, “covert vectors” likely refer to stealthy techniques used to plant the spyware on the target phone, such as azero-click exploit, where a Pegasus operator doesn’t need the victim to interact with a message or click a link to get hacked.

Theprices of spyware and zero-days can vary dependingon several factors: the customer, given that some spyware makers charge more when selling to countries like Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, for example; the number of concurrent targets that the customer can spy on at any given time; and feature add-ons, such as zero-click capabilities.

All of these factors could explain why a European customer would pay $7 million in 2019,while Saudi Arabia reportedly paid $55 millionandMexico paid $61 millionover the span of several years.

During the trial, Shohat answered questions about the company’s finances, some of which were disclosed in depositions ahead of the trial. These details were brought up in connection with how much in damages the spyware maker should pay to WhatsApp.

According to Shohat and documents provided by NSO Group, the spyware maker lost $9 million in 2023 and $12 million in 2024. The company also revealed it had $8.8 million in its bank account as of 2023, and $5.1 million in the bank as of 2024. Nowadays, the company burns through around $10 million each month, mostly to cover the salaries of its employees.

Also, it was revealed that Q Cyber had around $3.2 million in the bank both in 2023 and 2024.

During the trial, NSO revealed its research and development unit — responsible for finding vulnerabilities in software and figuring out how to exploit them — spent some $52 million in expenses during 2023, and $59 million in 2024. Shohat also said that NSO Group’s customers pay “somewhere in the range” between $3 million and “ten times that” for access to its Pegasus spyware.

Factoring in these numbers, the spyware maker was hoping to get away with paying little or no damages.

“To be honest, I don’t think we’re able to pay anything. We are struggling to keep our head above water,” Shohat said during his testimony. “We’re committing to my [chief financial officer] just to prioritize expenses and to make sure that we have enough money to meet our commitments, and obviously on a weekly basis.”

Technical,"Elon Musk has officially announced he’s stepping downas a U.S. special government employee and the de facto head of the Department of Government Efficiency, better known as DOGE.

The move follows Musk’s cooling relationship with the Trump administration andslumping Tesla salestied to his political advocacy. Despite his announced departure, Musk gave a shout-out to President Trump for the chance to tackle government waste, and he insisted that DOGE’s mission isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. Since launching, the organization has already slashed budgets across agencies, cut jobs, shut down departments, and stirred up plenty of controversy along the way.

Today, on TechCrunch’sEquitypodcast, hosts Kirsten Korosec, Max Zeff, and Anthony Ha unpack who else is departing DOGE, and why Silicon Valley’s relationship with politics is entering, as Kirsten put it, the “find out” stage.

Technical,"The White House is investigating after one or more people reportedly accessed the contacts from the personal phone of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, and used the information to contact other top officials and impersonate her.

Wiles reportedly told people that her phone was hacked. The Wall Street Journalfirst reportedthe hack of Wiles’ phone. CBS Newsalso confirmedthe reporting.

The hacker or hackers are said to have accessed Wiles’ phone contacts, including the phone numbers of other top U.S. officials and influential individuals. The WSJ reports some contacts received phone calls impersonating Wiles, which used AI to impersonate her voice and sent text messages from a number not associated with Wiles.

White House spokesperson Anna Kelly would not say, when asked by TechCrunch, if authorities had determined if a cloud account associated with Wiles’ personal device was compromised, or if Wiles’ phone was targeted by a more advanced cyberattack, such as one that involves the use of government-grade spyware.

In response, the White House said it “takes the cybersecurity of all staff very seriously, and this matter continues to be investigated.”

This is the second time Wiles has been targeted by hackers. In 2024,The Washington Postreported that Iranian hackers had attempted to compromise Wiles’ personal email account. The Journal said Friday, citing sources, the hackers were in fact successful in breaking into her email and obtained a dossier on [Vice President] JD Vance, then Trump’s running mate.

This is the latest cybersecurity incident to beset the Trump administration in the months since taking office.

In March, former White House top national security adviser Michael Waltzmistakenly added a journalistto a Signal group of top White House officials, including Vance and Wiles, which included discussions of a planned military air-strike in Yemen.

Reports later revealed that the government officials wereusing a Signal clone app called TeleMessage, which was designed to keep a copy of messages for government archiving. TeleMessage wassubsequently hacked on at least two occasions, revealing thecontents of its users’ private messages."
Technical,"X’s new DM feature, XChat, has begun rolling out to beta testers. Some X users who pay for the platform’s subscription product have reported that they can access XChat, while reverse engineerNima Owjiconfirmed to TechCrunch that the new messaging system appears to be ready to ship.

XChat is intended to be a more robust version of X’s existing DM (direct messages) feature, which is a holdover from before Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.

Some features that have been rumored to be part of XChat include group messages, end-to-end encryption, vanishing mode, the ability to mark messages as unread, and file sharing. Messages also appear to be secured behind a four-digit passcode.

Xannouncedon Thursday that it was pausing work on its encrypted DM feature, which could be related to the impending release of XChat, since this new system would render the existing DM interface obsolete. Paid subscribers on X have had access to alimited versionof encrypted messaging for two years.

In the years since he bought Twitter, Musk has spoken onnumerousoccasionsabout his ambitions to make a Signal-like messaging service embedded into X. If XChat really is gearing up for public use, then this news could represent Musk’s follow-through on that goal."
Technical,"Google’s AI assistant, Gemini, is gaining a more prominent place in your inbox with the launch of email summary cards, which will appear at the top of your emails. The companyannouncedThursday that users no longer have to tap an option to summarize an email with AI. Instead, the AI will now automatically summarize the content when needed, without requiring user interaction.

When Gemini launched in the side panel of Gmail last year, one of the features allowed users to summarize their long email threads, along with other tools like those to draft email messages or see suggested responses, among other things.

Now, Google is putting the AI to work on your inbox, whether or not it’s something you want to use.

The update is another example of how AI is quickly infiltrating the software and services people use the most, even though AI summariesaren’t always reliable. When Apple rolled out AI summaries for app push notifications, for example, the BBC found the feature made repeated mistakes when summarizing news headlines. Apple ended uppausing the AI summariesfor news apps.

Google’sown AI Overviews feature for Search hasalso repeatedly mademistakes, offering poor quality and inaccurate information at times.

With the new email summary cards, Gemini will list a longer email’s key points and will then continue to update that synopsis as replies arrive.

The feature won’t replace the option to manually click a button to summarize an email, Google notes. That will still appear as a chip at the top of the email and in Gmail’s Gemini side panel.

The feature is initially available only for emails in English.

Depending on your region, the summary cards may beturned onor off by default. (For instance, smart features are turned off in the EU, the U.K., Switzerland, and Japan, Google’s help documentation notes.) Others can choose toenable or disable the featurefrom Gmail’s Settings under “Smart features.” Workplace admins can also opt to disable the personalization settings for users from the Admin console."

Technical,"Elon Musk reportedly increased his drug use during the 2024 presidential campaign in which he donated around $270 million to help elect Donald Trump, according to sources who spoke toThe New York Times.

The Times reports that over the course of last year, his drug consumption went beyond recreational use. He reportedly carried a medication box with 20 pills, which included Adderall. Sources told the outlet that his use of ketamine was so rampant that it affected his bladder.

Musk’s use of drugs like ketamine, psychedelic mushrooms, and ecstasy iswell-documentedand reportedly a source of concern for board members at the numerous companies he runs, like Tesla and SpaceX. The latter is a large government contractor and must maintain a drug-free workplace. The Times report claims Musk received advanced notice of drug tests.

It’s not clear if his erratic behavior, like insulting cabinet members,doing the Nazi salute, andjumbled speechduring earnings calls and other events were directly correlated to his reported drug-taking.

The report also details how Musk’s increasing embrace of right-wing politics coincided with family troubles, like his custody battle with the musician Grimes over their five-year-old son, known as X.

Musk announced this week that he wasending his stintwith the government and stepping back from politics to focus on his businesses. He is scheduled to give a joint press conference with President Trump on Friday afternoon."
Technical,"It appears the Trump administration has imposed new export controls on chip design software as it seeks to furtherundermine China’s ability to make and use advanced AI chips.

Siemens EDA, Cadence Design Systems, and Synopsys all confirmed that they have received notices from the U.S. Commerce Department about new export controls on electronic automation design (EDA) software to China.

EDA tools are primarily used to aid with the design and validation of semiconductor manufacturing and testing, as well as for monitoring performance and quality. They are used by chip foundries, chipmakers, networking hardware companies, the automotive industry, and many more.

Siemens EDA, a division of German tech conglomerate Siemens, told TechCrunch that it has received a notice from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) last week about new export controls on EDA software to China and Chinese military end users.

“Siemens has supported customers in China for more than 150 years and will continue to work with our customers globally to mitigate the impact of these new restrictions while operating in compliance with applicable national export control regimes,” the company said.

U.S.-based Synopsys, which also makes EDA software,saidon Thursday that it had also received a similar letter from the BIS. The company also suspended its forecast for the third quarter and full-year 2025.

Cadence alsoreceiveda notice from the BIS saying a license is now required for “the export, re-export or in-country transfer of electronic design automation software” to customers in China.

The news was firstreportedby The Financial Times.

The new export rules come as the U.S. ramps up its efforts to hinder Chinese companies as the battle for AI supremacy heats up. But these export controls are increasingly hurting the U.S. chip industry, which has long enjoyed significant market share in China.

Nvidia alone hasincurred billions in lossesdue to restrictions on sales of its H20 and Hopper AI chips to Chinese customers. The company, along with rival AMD, is evensaid to beworking on selling lower-powered versions of its AI chips to Chinese customers.

The U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately return a request for comment outside regular business hours."
Technical,"Misfits Market, the online platform that delivers imperfect groceries to help minimize waste, announced the acquisition ofhousehold restocking serviceThe Roundson Friday.

As a result of the deal, Misfits Market plans to take on over 250 items from The Rounds’ inventory. This allows the company to diversify into additional categories, such as household items, including cleaning supplies and paper products.

In a bid to transition The Rounds customers to Misfits Market, the company is offering a $30 credit, along with a complimentary one-year subscription to its new Misfits+ membership, which includes exclusive weekly deals and free shipping.

The company declined to disclose the terms of the deal. It also couldn’t confirm whether layoffs would be part of the acquisition, as decisions are still being finalized. The Rounds has raised a total of $66 million from investors such as Andrew Chen (Andreessen Horowitz), Annie Kadavy (Redpoint Ventures), Construct Capital, and First Round Capital.

Along with diversifying its offerings, the deal will allow Misfits Market to collaborate with former partners from The Rounds, including major multifamily operators such as AvalonBay, Greystar, and Related.

Misfits Market also aims to gain a stronger foothold in the industry as a result of the deal. Notably, the company will continue to pursue M&A as part of a broader growth strategy, especially at a time when consumer awareness of food waste and sustainability is on the rise.

“This market is ripe for consolidation, and we are constantly looking at deals,” Misfits Market CEO Abhi Ramesh told TechCrunch.

This marks Misfits Market’s second acquisition, following its purchase ofImperfect Foodsin 2022, another competitor in the market.

Misfits Market, founded in 2018, offers produce that has been rejected by farmers and suppliers for being considered too “ugly” to sell in grocery stores, often due to being too small, oddly shaped, or having discoloration.

The Rounds, meanwhile, has offered its sustainable grocery delivery service since 2019 that refills home essentials using reusable packaging.

To date, Misfits Market has rescued more than 238 million pounds of food, according to the company. The Rounds has savedover 1 million poundsof packaging waste and estimates to save an average of 500,000 pounds of food each week."
Technical,"AI tools are touted as capable helpers that can easily help you research, code, summarize, write and bring you knowledge of any kind. But sometimes simple questions befuddle them.Google’s AI Overviews, for example, is confused what year it is.Several users reported over the past few days that when they asked Google what year it is, AI Overviews said the current year is 2024.

This reporter got the same answer on Thursday morning when Google was asked if it’s 2025 right now.

Google finally fixed the bug late on Thursday.

When asked why this happened, Google didn’t provide a particular reason, only saying that it was working on an update to avoid such issues.

“As with all Search features, we rigorously make improvements and use examples like this to update our systems. The vast majority of AI Overviews provide helpful, factual information, and we’re actively working on an update to address this type of issue,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

Google has been working on AI Overviews for a few years now, and the feature has so far madesome notable blunders— to name just a couple, it has recommended users eat“one small rock per day,”saying rocks are a good source of vitamins and minerals, and even suggestedadding glue in order to help cheese stick to a pizza. When the company rolled out the feature in Hindi in India, TechCrunch found thatits answers were often inconsistent and confusing.

In recent weeks, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has touted usage numbers for AI Overviews, saying thatthe feature is now being used by 1.5 billion users in over 100 countries. He also added that in markets like the U.S. and India, the feature is driving over 10% usage of the search engine for related queries. The company is betting a lot on driving people to use itsAI-powered search and Q&A features more."
Technical,"Grammarly has secured a $1 billion commitment from General Catalyst. The 16-year-old writing assistant startup will use the new funds for its sales and marketing efforts, freeing up existing capital to make strategic acquisitions.

Unlike a traditional venture round, General Catalyst will not receive an equity stake in the company in return for the investment. Instead, Grammarly will repay the capital along with a fixed, capped percentage of revenue it generates from the use of General Catalyst’s funds.

The investment comes from General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund (CVF), a capital pool that helps late-stage startups with predictable revenue streams deploy new funding specifically to growing their businesses. CVF’s alternative financing strategy essentially “lends” capital that is secured by a company’s recurring revenue.

For companies like Grammarly, this form of financing is advantageous because it’s nondilutive and does not reset the company’s valuation. Grammarly was valuedat $13 billion in 2021, during the peak of the ZIRP (zero interest-rate policy) era. However, the company’s valuation in today’s market is significantly lower, according to an investor in the company who asked to remain anonymous.

Grammarly didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

In December, Grammarly acquired productivitystartup Codaand appointed its CEO, Shishir Mehrotra, to lead Grammarly. The company, which is evolving into an AI productivity tool following the acquisition, has annual revenue ofover $700 million.

General Catalyst’s Customer Value Fund has provided funding tonearly 50 companies, including insurtech Lemonade and telehealth platform Ro. CVF maintains its own distinct limited partners and was not included in the firm’s recent$8 billion capitalraise.

General Catalyst head honcho Hemant Taneja and Pranav Singhvi, co-head of CVF, talked with TechCrunch in greater length about the group’s specialized financing strategylast fall."

Technical,"AI dev platformHugging Facecontinued its push into robotics on Thursday with the release of two new humanoid robots.

The company announced a pair of open source robots, HopeJR and Reachy Mini. HopeJR is a full-size humanoid robot that has 66 actuated degrees of freedom, or 66 independent movements, including the ability to walk and move its arms. Reachy Mini is a desktop unit that can move its head, talk, listen, and be used to test AI apps.

Hugging Face doesn’t have an exact timeline for shipping these robots. The company’s co-founder and CEO, Clem Delangue, told TechCrunch over email that they expect to start shipping at least the first few units by the end of the year, and the waitlist is currently open.

Hugging Face estimates that the HopeJR will cost around $3,000 per unit and the Reachy Mini will cost around $250 to $300, depending on tariffs.

“The important aspect is that these robots are open source, so anyone can assemble, rebuild, [and] understand how they work, and [that they’re] affordable, so that robotics doesn’t get dominated by just a few big players with dangerous black-box systems,” Delangue said via email.

This robot release was made possible in part by the company’s acquisition of humanoid robotics startupPollen Robotics, which was announced in April, according to Delangue. He added that the Pollen team gave Hugging Face “new capabilities” required to make these bots.

Hugging Face has been making a concerted push into the robotics industry over the past few years. It launchedLeRobot, a collection of open AI models, datasets, and tools to build robotics systems, in 2024.

So far in 2025, the company has released an updated version of its 3D-printed and programmable robotic arm,the SO-101, which the company built in a partnership with French robotics firm The Robot Studio. It alsoexpanded the training data on its LeRobot platform, through a partnership with AI startup Yaak, to include training data for self-driving machines."
Technical,"Black Forest Labs, the AI startup whose models once powered theimage generation features of X’s Grok chatbot, on Thursday released a new suite of image-generating models — some of which can both createandedit pics.

The most capable of the models in the new family, called Flux.1 Kontext, can be prompted with text and, optionally, a reference image to create new images, writes Black Forest Labs in ablog post.

“The Flux.1 Kontext models deliver state-of-the-art image generation results with strong prompt following, photorealistic rendering, and competitive typography — all at inference speeds up to 8x faster than current leading models,” the company writes in its post.

Flux.1 Kontext comes as the race to build competitive image generators heats up. Google debuted its latest image-generating model,Imagen 4, earlier this month at the company’s I/O developer conference. Earlier this year, OpenAI brought avastly improvedimage-generating model to ChatGPT — a model that quickly went viral for its ability to create art in the style of Studio Ghibli movies.

There are two models in the Flux.1 Kontext family: Flux.1 Kontex [pro] and Flux.1 Kontex [max]. The former allows users to generate an image and refine it through multiple “turns,” all while preserving the characters and styles in the images. Flux.1 Kontex [max] focuses on speed, consistency, and adherence to prompts.

Unlike some of Black Forest Labs’ previous models, Flux.1 Kontex [pro] and Flux.1 Kontex [max] can’t be downloaded for offline use. However, Black Forest Labs is making an “open” Kontext model, Flux.1 Kontext [dev], available in private beta for research and safety testing.

Black Forest Labs is also launching a model playground that allows users to try its models without having to sign up for a third-party service. New users get 200 credits, enough to generate around 12 images with Flux.1 Kontex [pro].

Technical,"Tinder is leaning into dating apps’ reputation for superficiality with the launch of a new feature that lets paid subscribers add their height preferences to their profiles.

After a Reddit userposted a photoof the new height setting in the Tinder app, a company spokesperson confirmed to TechCrunch that the discovery setting has been launched as a global test.

Tinder Gold and Premium subscribers in the test group will have access to the feature, but not free users, we’re told. In addition, the setting will indicate a preference, rather than functioning as a “hard filter,” the company says. That means it won’t actually block or exclude profiles but instead inform recommendations.

“We’re always listening to what matters most to our Tinder users — and testing the paid height preference is a great example of how we’re building with urgency, clarity, and focus,” said Phil Price Fry, VP Comms at Tinder, in an emailed statement. “This is part of a broader effort to help people connect more intentionally on Tinder. Our new product principles guide every decision, and this one speaks directly to a few: prioritizing user outcomes, moving fast, and learning quickly. Not every test becomes a permanent feature, but every test helps us learn how we can deliver smarter, more relevant experiences and push the category forward.”

While typically dating apps let users filter for people by more traditional concerns, like someone’s age or whether they want a long-term relationship or kids, the height setting is likely to cause more controversy and concern.

Since the rise of online dating, a focus on someone’s physicality — like their looks or size — has become a primary factor in determining who’s worth a match. Tinder helped accelerate this trend thanks to its user interface, which puts a heavy emphasis on looking through people’s photos. Other Tinder users often quickly react to those photos with left or right swipes to indicate interest.

In addition to exposing people’s preferences for the conventionally attractive, dating apps’ popularity led to a culture where abias toward taller menbecame the norm. It’snot uncommon to come across profileswhere women state they’re only looking for matches who are at least 6 feet tall, for instance — even if in real life they’d be more flexible about this requirement.

Tinder has even poked fun at this trend in previous years, like when it made an April Fools’ Dayannouncementthat it wouldintroducea “height verification” feature in its app. (Many mendidn’t findthis particular joke funny.) The height bias has also been the subject of other parodies, like whendesigner Soren Iverson imagineda version of Tinder that let men override users’ height requirements for a fee.

The company may hope that the addition of a height setting could encourage more women to use and pay for the app, which tends to be more heavilydominated by men both in the U.S.andinternationally.

The test’s launch follows Tinder parent Match’s recent earnings, whichrevealed a 5% fall in paying users. Paid subscribers across Match’s dating apps fell to 14.2 million in the first quarter, down from 14.9 million users a year ago. The company is in the middle ofanother CEO transition, with Match CEO Spencer Rascoff set to run Tinder too later this summer."
Technical,"Delaware’s attorney general is hiring an investment bank to advise onOpenAI’s for-profit conversion, the Wall Street Journalreportedon Wednesday. The independent evaluation could prolong the transition, or gum up OpenAI’s plans even further.

OpenAI’s conversion will help it attract new investment andeventually go public, but first, the startup needs to secure approvals from state regulators. Although OpenAI and Microsoft have hired their own investment banks to advise on the deal, Delaware’s attorney general is now seeking an independent evaluation of the equity that OpenAI’s nonprofit will receive.

Regulators seem to be zeroing in on a key factor in OpenAI’s conversion, which could significantly affect the price OpenAI ultimately pays to simplify its structure. Corporate governance experts sayElon Musk may have raised the price of OpenAI’s nonprofitwhen he submitted a $97.4 billion takeover bid for the startup, despite the fact that OpenAI promptly rejected it."
Technical,"Perplexity, the AI-powered search engine gunning for Google, on Thursday releasedPerplexity Labs, a tool for subscribers to Perplexity’s $20-per-month Pro plan that can craft reports, spreadsheets, dashboards, and more.

Perplexity Labs is available on the web, iOS, and Android, and coming soon to Perplexity’s apps for Mac and Windows.

“Perplexity Labs can help you complete a variety of work and personal projects,” Perplexityexplainsin a blog post. “Labs is designed to invest more time — 10 minutes or longer — and leverage additional tools [to accomplish tasks], such as advanced file generation and mini-app creation.”

Labs, which arrives the same day as viral AI agent platformManusreleased a slide deck creation tool, is a part of Perplexity’s effort to broaden beyond its core business of search. Perplexity is currently previewing a web browser,Comet, and recently acquiredRead.vc, a social media network for professionals.

Perplexity Labs, powered by AI, can conduct research and analysis, taking around 10 minutes and using tools like web search, code execution, and chart and image creation to craft reports and visualizations. Labs can create interactive web apps, Perplexity says, and write code to structure data, apply formulas, and create documents.

All files created during a Perplexity Labs workflow — such as charts, images, and code files — are organized in a tab from where they can be viewed or downloaded. “This expanded capability empowers you to develop a broader array of deliverables for your projects,” according to Perplexity’s blog post.

It all sounds good in theory, but AI being an imperfect technology, Labs likely doesn’t always hit the mark. Of course, we’ll reserve judgment until we have a chance to test it.

Perplexity has increasingly invested in corporate-focused functionality, last summerlaunchingan enterprise plan with user management, “internal knowledge search,” and more. The moves could be in part at the behest of the VCs backing Perplexity, who are no doubt eager to see a return sooner than later.

Technical,"Heron Power, the electrical grid-focused startup founded by former Tesla executive Drew Baglino, announced Thursday it has raised $38 million in a Series A funding round.

Heron Poweris developing solid-state transformers, which promise to be more compact and responsive than the century-old analog models. Transformers are key parts of the electrical grid, stepping voltage up and down as it moves through the system.

Heron focuses on so-called medium-voltage transformers, which covers a range of possible applications, from large substations behind fences to the green metal boxes found throughout residential neighborhoods.

Heron Powersaid it’s targeting initial installations in early 2027, and it’s partnering with “major energy and data center developers.”

Technical,"On Thursday, Anduril and Meta announced news that feels like a fairy tale ending for Anduril co-founder Palmer Luckey. The two companies are working together to build extended reality (XR) devices for the U.S. military, Andurilannouncedin a blog post.

“I am glad to be working with Meta once again,” Luckey is quoted as saying in the post. “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.”

This partnership stems from the Soldier Borne Mission Command (SBMC) Next program, formerly called the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next. IVAS was a massive military contract, with a total $22 billion budget, originally awarded to Microsoft in 2018 intended to develop HoloLens-like AR glasses for soldiers.

But after endless problems, in February the Army strippedmanagement of the program from Microsoft and awarded it to Anduril, with Microsoft staying on as a cloud provider. The intent is to eventually have multiple suppliers of mixed reality glasses for soldiers.

All of this meant that if Luckey’s former employer, Meta, wanted to tap into the potentially lucrative world of military VR/AR/XR headsets, it would need to go through Anduril.

The devices will be based on tech out of Meta’s AR/VR research center Reality Labs, the post says. They’ll use Meta’s Llama AI model, and they will tap into Anduril’s command and control software known as Lattice. The idea is to provide soldiers with a heads-up display of battlefield intelligence in real time.

Luckey is apparently feeling good about this reconciliation. He was, of course,famously firedfrom Facebook in 2017, about three years after Facebook bought his startup Oculus for $2 billion. This came after Luckey was embroiled in a brouhaha over his support for Donald Trump in his 2016 election. Luckey turned around and founded Anduril in 2017, with co-founders Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, and Matt Grimm.

An Anduril spokesperson tells TechCrunch that the product family Meta and Anduril are building is even called EagleEye, which will be an ecosystem of devices.

EagleEye is what Luckey named Anduril’s first imagined headset in Anduril’s pitch deck draft, before his investors convinced him to focus on building software first.

“All of them had worked with me for years via Oculus VR, and when they saw the EagleEye headset in our first Anduril pitch deck draft, they pointed out that it seemed like I was sequencing things irrationally. They believed, correctly, that I was too focused on winning a pissing contest over the future of AR/VR, on proving that I was right and the people who fired me were wrong,”Luckey tweetedin February after winning the IVAS contract.

After Thursday’s news, Luckeyposted on X: “It is pretty cool to have everything at our fingertips for this joint effort – everything I made before Meta acquired Oculus, everything we made together, and everything we did on our own after I was fired.”

And to show that Luckey has really buried the hatchet, he said Anduril has even launched aFacebook page."
Technical,"YouTubeannouncedon Thursday that it’s bringing Google Lens to YouTube Shorts in the coming weeks. With this integration, viewers will soon be able to use Google Lens to search what they see while watching Shorts.

For example, if you’re watching a Short filmed in a location that you’re interested in visiting, you can select a landmark and ask Lens to identify it. From there, you would be able to learn more about the destination’s culture and history.

By integrating Lens into Shorts, YouTube is working to enhance visual search capabilities and give users more ways to discover and search for content in an intuitive and interactive way.

It makes sense for the company to enhance search capabilities for YouTube Shorts viewers by leveraging Google Lens, especially since TikTok and Instagram Reels don’t offer similar functionality.

Once the functionality rolls out, users will be able to try it out by pausing a Short and then selecting the “Lens” option in the top menu. Then they will need to either draw, highlight, or tap on something they want to search. Lens will then provide visual matches and search results overlaid on the Short. Once you’re done with the Short, you can jump back into the content that you were watching.

Users won’t see ads in search results during the beta phase of Lens in Shorts, YouTube says. The Google-owned company also notes that Lens in Shorts isn’t available for Shorts with YouTube Shopping affiliate links or with paid product promotions.

YouTube is starting to roll out the beta to all viewers this week.

Today’s announcement comes as YouTube has been building out Shorts with added capabilities to take on TikTok and Instagram Reels.

In April, YouTubeannounced new upcoming featuresthat are designed to help creators publish engaging short-form videos. Creators will get access to an improved video editor, the ability to generate AI stickers, a feature that syncs content to the beat of a song, enhanced templates, and more."
Technical,"DeepSeek’supdated R1 reasoning AI modelmight be getting the bulk of the AI community’s attention this week. But the Chinese AI lab also released a smaller, “distilled” version of its new R1, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, that DeepSeek claims beats comparably sized models on certain benchmarks.

The smaller updated R1, which was built using theQwen3-8B modelAlibaba launched in May as a foundation, performs better than Google’sGemini 2.5 Flashon AIME 2025, a collection of challenging math questions.

DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B also nearly matches Microsoft’s recently releasedPhi 4 reasoning plusmodel on another math skills test, HMMT.

So-called distilled models like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B are generally less capable than their full-sized counterparts. On the plus side, they’re far less computationally demanding.Accordingto the cloud platform NodeShift, Qwen3-8B requires a GPU with 40GB-80GB of RAM to run (e.g., an Nvidia H100). The full-sized new R1 needsaround a dozen 80GB GPUs.

DeepSeek trained DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B by taking text generated by the updated R1 and using it to fine-tune Qwen3-8B. In a dedicated web page for the model on the AI dev platform Hugging Face, DeepSeek describes DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as “for both academic research on reasoning models and industrial development focused on small-scale models.”

DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is available under a permissive MIT license, meaning it can be used commercially without restriction. Several hosts, includingLM Studio, already offer the model through an API."
Technical,"The U.S. government imposed sanctions on Funnull, a company accused of providing infrastructure for cybercriminals running “pig butchering” crypto scams that have led to $200 million in losses for American victims.

On Thursday, the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controlannouncedthe sanctions, saying Funnull is “linked to the majority of virtual currency investment scam websites reported to the FBI.” The press release said that the $200 million in losses results in an average loss of $150,000 per victim, but that the numbers “likely underestimate the total losses, as many victims of scams do not report the crime.”

Pig butchering scamsinvolve criminals approaching victims online, often pretending to be interested in a romantic relationship, with the goal of tricking the victims into sending them money to invest in nonexistent crypto projects.

According to the Treasury, Funnull is based in the Philippines and run by Chinese-national Liu Lizhi, who was also sanctioned on Thursday.

Funnull, according to the Treasury, generated domain names for websites on IP addresses it owns, and provided “web design templates to cybercriminals.”

“These services not only make it easier for cybercriminals to impersonate trusted brands when creating scam websites, but also allow them to quickly change to different domain names and IP addresses when legitimate providers attempt to take the websites down,” the Treasury said.

The FBIreleased an alertthat included more information about these activities.

The Treasury referred tothe Polyfill supply chain attackin its press release, saying Funnell “purchased a repository of code used by web developers and maliciously altered the code to redirect visitors of legitimate websites to scam websites and online gambling sites, some of which are linked to Chinese criminal money laundering operations.”

Those activities are exactly whatresearchers from cybersecurity firm Silent Push accused FUNNULL of carrying out last year. Researchers found that Funnull was responsible for the Polyfill supply chain attack, which was launched to push malware to whoever visited websites that used Polyfill’s code. The goal was to redirect users to a malicious network of casino and online gambling sites, the researchers found.

Zach Edwards, a researcher at Silent Push who worked on the Funnull report last year, told TechCrunch that he was “really glad to see the facts aligned with our suspicions.”

“It’s encouraging that the Treasury has taken actions against the largest pig butchering and money laundering network that exists targeting people in the U.S., but we know that more needs to be done,” said Edwards. “This effort from Funnull is the tip of the iceberg for what is actually going on right now out of China with financial schemes targeting Americans.”

“Global threat actors that are targeting Americans with financial scams need to be held accountable, and doxing the companies they work with and the individuals who run those companies, is an important first step,” he added."
Technical,"Tesla is a business built, in part, on government regulations and incentives, from a Department of Energyloan guaranteein 2009 to the regulatory credits it sells to other automakers, which have drivena thirdof its $32 billion in profits since 2012.

Now, the company’s energy business — a rarebright spotamidfaltering demandfor its EVs — is under assault.

House Republicans passed a reconciliation bill last week that would undo much of the Inflation Reduction Act, including tax credits for residential solar installations and for clean energy projects. That bill is now before the Senate.

If the Senate were to pass it with those repeals in tact, it could have a devastating impact on Tesla’s energy division, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in the first quarter, a 67% increase year-over-year.

With CEOElon Muskclaiming that his time in government has come to an end, Tesla has taken to lobbying legislators on X. There, Tesla Energyappealedto Senate Republicans.

“Abruptly ending the energy tax credits would threaten America’s energy independence and the reliability of our grid – we urge the senate to enact legislation with a sensible wind down of 25D and 48e,” Tesla posted on X. “This will ensure continued speedy deployment of over 60 GW capacity per year to support AI and domestic manufacturing growth.”

Today, homeowners qualify for 30% tax credits on new solar installations, while clean energy developers can generally claim the same. Those provisions are currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2032, but House Republicans want to end the credits four years earlier and require projects to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage.

Cutting those parts of the law could risk the deployment of 60 gigawatts of capacity annually “to support AI and domestic manufacturing support,” Tesla said.

The Trump administration has made “energy dominance” a key priority, and slowing the deployment of renewable and clean energy puts that goal at risk.

Last year,93%of all new generating capacity in the U.S. was clean energy, mostly solar and grid-scale storage. In the first quarter this year, renewables added 7.4 gigawatts, the second best Q1 ever. Queues for new natural gas turbines stretch for years, while solar farms can generally be completed in 18 months.

Like many residential solar installers, Tesla’s energy business is heavily dependent on tax incentives. Since Republicans have prioritized repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, American solar stocks have taken a beating. This year, Enphase is down 45%, Sunrun has lost a quarter of its share price, and First Solar is off 15%."
Technical,"Just ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference next month, Apple on Thursdayannouncednew figures related to the U.S. App Store’s financial success. The company says its U.S. App Store ecosystem has generated $406 billion in developer billings and sales in 2024 — a figure that’s nearly tripled in size since 2019, when it then generated $142 billion.

Apple also made a point to note that, for 90% of the billings and sales facilitated by the App Store, developers paid no commission.

The new figures come from an Apple-funded study conducted by Professor Andrey Fradkin from Boston University Questrom School of Business and economist Dr. Jessica Burley from Analysis Group. Analysis Group has beenworking with Apple for yearsamid growing antitrust scrutiny to create reports and studies that showcase the App Store’s market power in a more favorable light and as a net positive for developers.

In particular, these studies have stressed that only a small sliver of Apple’s developer base even pays Apple commissions, and the majority of those who do so are on a Small Business plan or other programs where their commission is reduced from the standard 30% to 15%.

However, those findings haven’t protected Apple from being forced to open up the App Store to increased competition in the U.S.

Last month, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogersruled that Apple had violated the court’s order arising from Fortnite maker Epic Games’ lawsuitthat had required Apple to reform its App Store’s policy around external payments. As a result of that ruling, Apple was forced to letdevelopers add links to their app that point to web payment options, where Apple is not allowed to take a commission.

Apple is now in the processof appealingthe ruling.

The years-long fight over App Store commissions has led to increased hostility and disappointment from members of the iOS developer community,who believe thattheir applications are part of the reason for the iPhone’s historical success. Many feel they should be treated with more gratitude for their efforts, and not as a resource to extract money from.

Apple, on the other hand, staunchly believes that the App Store itself is the reason for the developers’ success, as it provides the marketplace that allows consumers to discover new apps and easily pay for the developers’ software and services.

That comes through in Apple’s latest report as well, where Apple notes that earnings for U.S.-based developers have more than doubled over the last five years, while small business developers have seen earnings increase by 76% from 2021 to 2024. (The latter number is not surprising. In 2020,Apple launched its Small Business Programthat reduced commissions for developers making less than $1 million per year. An earnings increase is to be expected.)

Apple also reminds U.S. developers that its App Store allows them to reach a global market of 175 countries and regions, and itprevents billions in fraudulent transactions. Its developer investments include 250,000 APIs,  as part of frameworks like HealthKit, Metal, Core ML, MapKit, and SwiftUI.

Additionally, the new report highlights how much developers are making from the App Store in areas where they don’t have to pay commission.

For instance, Apple says that last year, the U.S. App Store ecosystem facilitated $277 billion in total billings and sales from physical goods and services, $75 billion from in-app advertising, and $53 billion from digital goods and services. It also notes that, since 2019, spending on physical goods and services more than tripled and in-app spending on digital goods and services and in-app advertising more than doubled. General retail spending and grocery delivery increased more than fourfold."
Technical,"Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s newest AI model, anupdated versionof the company’sR1 reasoning model, achieves impressive scores on benchmarks for coding, math, and general knowledge, nearly surpassing OpenAI’s flagship o3. But the upgraded R1, also known as “R1-0528,” might also be less willing to answer contentious questions, in particular questions about topics the Chinese government considers to be controversial.

That’s according to testing conducted by the pseudonymous developer behindSpeechMap, a platform to compare how different models treat sensitive and controversial subjects. The developer, who goes by the username “xlr8harder” on X, claims that R1-0528 is “substantially” less permissive of contentious free speech topics than previous DeepSeek releases and is “the most censored DeepSeek model yet for criticism of the Chinese government.”

As Wiredexplainedin a piece from January, models in China are required to follow stringent information controls. A 2023 law forbids models from generating content that “damages the unity of the country and social harmony,” which could be construed as content that counters the government’s historical and political narratives. To comply, Chinese startups often censor their models by either using prompt-level filters or fine-tuning them. Onestudyfound that DeepSeek’s original R1 refuses to answer 85% of questions about subjects deemed by the Chinese government to be politically controversial.

According to xlr8harder, R1-0528 censors answers to questions about topics like the internment camps in China’s Xinjiang region, where more than a million Uyghur Muslims have been arbitrarily detained. While it sometimes criticizes aspects of Chinese government policy — in xlr8harder’s testing, it offered the Xinjiang camps as an example of human rights abuses — the model often gives the Chinese government’s official stance when asked questions directly.

TechCrunch observed this in our brief testing, as well.

China’s openly available AI models, including video-generating models such asMagi-1andKling, have attractedcriticismin the past for censoring topics sensitive to the Chinese government, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre. In December, Clément Delangue, the CEO of AI dev platform Hugging Face,warnedabout the unintended consequences of Western companies building on top of well-performing, openly licensed Chinese AI."
Technical,"This month, cybersecurity company Thinkst will mark its 10th anniversary since the launch of its now-flagship product, Canary. The company debuted Canary after seeing companies spend millions of dollars on cybersecurity products, yet were still taking months or longer to realize that they had been breached.

Thinkstbelieved it could make a digital tripwire product that would catch hackers in the act, and by all accounts, it did just that.

Over the past decade, the company has grown to around 40 employees, mostly developers and engineers; hasn’t taken on any outside funding; and is on track this year to make a healthy profit on $20 million in annual recurring revenue,almost double from 2021, Thinkst founder Haroon Meer told TechCrunch.

It’s an impressive, if not refreshing feat, at a time when many cybersecurity companies are driven by breakneck growth and speed and fueled by venture capital.

Meer, who founded Thinkst and serves as its chief executive from Cape Town in South Africa, told TechCrunch in a call earlier this month that Thinkst made it this far by focusing on its customers and what they need — specifically a product that does what it says it does — and not growing the company at an uncontrolled rate. Meer said this approach is working, pointing to 60% of its first-year customers who are still with the company today.

“We’re not artificially holding back growth, but we’re also not doing any of the really silly, ‘pour gasoline on the fire’ growth-at-all-costs stuff,” said Meer. “What you have to do is keep the promises that you make, and you’ll grow into the people that are right for you.”

In 2015, Thinkst launched its Canary hardware product — named after acanary in a coal mine, essentially a very early warning system — that can detect and alert when hackers are present on a company’s network.

A canary is set up like a honeypot, so that when a malicious hacker (or anauthorized pen-testerstress-testing a company’s defenses) accesses the canary thinking they struck it lucky by accessing a Windows PC with an open file share, or a server packed with customer data, secret API keys, or a vital service for a company’s operations, the canary will send an alert about the breach and allow the company to take immediate action.

The canary’s purpose is to reduce the amount of time that hackers have to sneak around on a victim’s network to search for sensitive data, plant malware, or otherwise cause damage before getting caught. The average hacker has around 24 days on a victim’s network before detection, according to Verizon’s most recent annual data breach report.

The company also offersCanary Tokens, its free and public offering that lets anyone drop an item of ostensible value, like a password, document, or a credit card number, for example, in a safe place so that when someone accesses or opens the item, you are alerted at the same moment your safe place was compromised.

“One of the things we got accidentally lucky with is it’s really hard to deploy a canary wrong,” said Meer. “If you make it fit in, then you catch attackers, and if you make it stick out, you catch attackers.” After all, if a malicious hacker sees an advantage to get what they need faster, they’re going to take the opportunity.

“It’s rare for us to have a week without getting an email from a customer saying this saved our lives, or we had a pen test and this is the only thing that caught our attackers,” said Meer.

It is these success stories that “fuels” the company, said Meer, and helps drive the company’s organic sales growth. Thinkst does not have an outbound sales team; instead, the company relies largely on word of mouth, or existing customers who want to buy more of the company’s honeypots.

Meer said that while Thinkst hasn’t taken any outside funding to date, he does not begrudge the VC industry and values its insights. While conceding that some companies cannot get to where they are without heavy cash injections, he argues that money is “not the gate that stops you from doing stuff.” Meer said that companies focusing on making their products work and their customers happy is core to good business.

“My main thing is that you should run the business in a way that you are still attractive for investment or acquisition,” said Meer. “If you build a good enough business so that you don’t need it, you can always ask for it when you do.”

Meer was not shy about his company’s ambitions. “We think every company should be running at least five canaries now,” he said. Some companies have a handful of canaries and some into the hundreds or more. “There’s a bunch of stuff that we could do to make more money; we just don’t think that’s necessary right now, because what we’re doing is offering a good product at a fair price, and that’s growing.”

“We are $20 million now, but we don’t think $20 million is our ceiling,” said Meer."

He went on to state that Meta’s plan is to keep building out the AI assistant before creating a business around it. As the assistant gets upgraded over time, Zuckerberg said “there will be opportunities to either insert paid recommendations” or launch “a subscription service so that people can pay to use more compute.”

Technical,"For years, people have been worried — both rightly and otherwise — that electric vehicles could strain the grid to the breaking point. But as they spread, and as EV technology advances, some think theserolling battery packscould become a lifeline for the United States’ aging electrical system.

“In the future, the electric vehicle will be the center of the entire energy grid,” Peter Wilson, co-founder and CEO ofVolteras, told TechCrunch.

The potential is there: Last year, the U.S. installed37.1 gigawatt-hoursof grid-scale energy storage. The country could increase that amount by nearly 10 times if every EV on the road today was hooked up to a charger that can feed electricity back into the grid.

There are a few hurdles, of course. Many new EVs today don’t support vehicle-to-grid connections, though that’s changing, and there’s a lack of affordable bidirectional chargers. ButVolterashas been making headway on the software side.

Recently, the London-based startup closed an $11.1 million Series A led by Union Square Ventures, with participation from Edenred, Exor, Long Journey Ventures, and Wex, Volteras exclusively told TechCrunch.

Volteras is building virtual connective tissue that will allow plugged-in EVs to offer their batteries to support the grid. When massed together, they can serve as virtual power plants, giving utilities quickly dispatchable power that’s distributed across the grid. Along with control over the car’s battery, Volteras also gets access to a host of other connected-car features, like remote unlocking and telematics.

The company integrates with automakers’ own APIs and offers those functions to other companies interested in using them. In the case of a virtual power plant, a utility can pay EV owners to sell some of the car’s stored electricity back to the grid. Car rental services might subscribe, too, so they can remotely unlock vehicles for stranded motorists. Volteras charges those companies a monthly fee per connected car and passes on some of that revenue to automakers.

Several companies are working on similar solutions to smooth the connection of EV batteries to the grid —Texture,EV.energy, andGreenely, to name a few — but Wilson argues that Volteras has a head start because his company is currently working with more than 30 automakers, which include Ford, BMW, Tesla, Stellantis, and Volvo. “We’re going to cover like 90% of the automotive market worldwide by the end of the year,” he said.

Automakers have been salivating over the financial prospects of connected cars, though progress has been spotty. GM, for example, in 2021set a bold targetfor its subscription services: $25 billion in revenue by the end of the decade. But in itsmost recent annual report, the automaker didn’t offer an update. (Usually when things are going well, companies tell the world about it.)

Wilson still sees potential in connected services, starting with the battery. In addition to virtual power plants, Volteras is courting fleet managers, EV routing apps, and insurers interested in offering usage-based plans.

“This kind of hidden data layer that you don’t see — that’ll be the crux of how companies offer services to you, give you discounts, and make it more affordable to own an electric vehicle,” Wilson said."
Technical,"Nearly two years aftersuing OpenAI and Microsoftfor copyright infringement, The New York Times has agreed to license its editorial content to Amazon to train the tech giant’s AI platforms.

The agreement will “bring Times editorial content to a variety of Amazon customer experiences,” theoutlet saidin a statement. That includes content like news articles, material from NYT Cooking, a site dedicated to food and recipes, and The Athletic, its sports-focused site.

The company also noted that Amazon’s use of The Times’s editorial content could extend to Alexa software on its smart speakers.

“Whenever it makes sense within the consumer experience on Amazon’s products, they will provide direct links to Times products, where readers can get the full Times experience,” Danielle Rhoades Ha, a New York Times spokesperson, told TechCrunch.

The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it’s the first of such agreements for Amazon. OpenAI has signedmultiple similar deals with publishers, including The Washington Post, The Atlantic, The Guardian, NewsCorp, Axel Springer, and more.

This is also the first time The Times is agreeing to a generative AI-focused licensing arrangement, and it comes after the outlet accused OpenAI and Microsoft of using millions of articles published by The Times to train their AI models without consent or compensation.

“We have a long-standing approach to ensure that our work is valued appropriately, whether through commercial deals or through the enforcement of our intellectual property rights,” the spokesperson said.

Both OpenAI and Microsoft have rejected allegations of wrongdoing.

Technical,"Zeal Capital Partners announced on Wednesday the close of its second fund, raising $82 million. Limited partners in the fund include Citi Impact Fund, M&T Bank, Wells Fargo, and Spelman College. It hopes to invest in at least 25 early-stage companies, writing check sizes between $1 million and $2.3 million, with 50% of the fund reserved for follow-on investments.

Speaking to TechCrunch, Nasir Qadree,founder and managing partner of Zeal,said Fund II will focus on financial technology, healthcare, and future of work, as its other fund did. It has already invested in at least five companies, including the maternal health platform Seven Starling and the fintech Debbie.

Qadree described the funding environment for Fund II as “undoubtedly challenging” because of macroeconomic uncertainty, LP rebalancing, and tighter allocation windows.

“But these headwinds also sharpened our strategy and reaffirmed the strength of our approach,” Qadree said. “I’m proud to share that over 80% of our limited partners from Zeal Fund I continued with us into Fund II, a signal of deep conviction in our ability to consistently back category-defining companies.”

Black-led and founded funds such as this have been making some sizeable closes lately.

Slauson & Co.announced a $100 millionFund II last September, followed by Illumen Capital, founded by Daryn Dodson, announcing theraise of a $32.75 millionfund in November. This year, Sydney Thomas’ Symphonic Capital announced theraise of a $13.5 millioninaugural fund, while Cherryrock Capital, founded by Stacy Brown-Philpot, announced theraise of its $172 millionFund I.

Some of these funds are general in their mission, while others are more explicit in their target of underrepresented communities, showing that appetite still exists for such funds, despite the pressure from the current U.S. presidential administration, and among those that support it, against anything that could be considered “DEI.”

Overall, Zeal, a more generalist fund founded in 2019, has invested in 40 companies. Fund I announced itsclose at $62.1 millionin 2021."
Technical,"In the construction industry, managers can easily become disconnected from what’s happening on-site. Among the many tasks to juggle are staying apprised of costs, communicating with all stakeholders, and assessing risk related to aspects like contractor billing and performance.

Buildotswants to change all of that through AI and computer vision.

Founded in 2018 by Roy Danon, Aviv Leibovici and Yakir Sudry, the Chicago startup offers a platform that tracks construction progress by processing images captured from 360-degree cameras mounted on managers’ hard hats. The system doesn’t just observe; it also forecasts. Teams can use a chatbot to ask questions about a project’s status, and check a predictive tool that alerts them to possible delay risks or pacing issues that could turn into costly problems.

“It’s transformative for site managers, construction executives, and other stakeholders,” said Danon, Buildots’ CEO, who tells TechCrunch the company’s clients include Intel and around 50 construction firms. “[They’re] able to make informed decisions based on real, measurable data as opposed to information trickling in at different times from different sources and with different levels of reliability.”

To build on its momentum, Buildots has raised $45 million in a Series D funding round led by Qumra Capital, with participation from OG Venture Partners, TLV Partners, Poalim Equity, Future Energy Ventures, and Viola Growth. The new cash brings the company’s total raised to $166 million.

According to Danon, the capital will mainly be used to expand Buildot’s product to “cover more stages of the construction life cycle.” The plan is to use historical data to train AI models to further benchmark — and optimize — construction project performance.

Buildots isn’t the only company applying AI in the construction domain. Others includeBeamUp, which is developing an AI-powered building design platform, andVersatile, which — like Buildots — captures and analyzes data across the construction site to provide a picture of construction progress.

With over 230 employees, Buildots ranks among the larger players in the space — and it’s planning to expand its North American operations this year, with a focus on growing its R&D teams.

“[Our] differentiation is strong due to our operations-focused platform and our approach to performance management in construction,” Danon said. “The funding will accelerate all of [our] initiatives, but more importantly, it validates that the market is ready for the transformation that we’re bringing.”"
Technical,"As Kevin Malone from “The Office”once said, “Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?”

For Julia LeStage and Lisa Le, the creators of a new dating app calledLoveJack, finding love online doesn’t have to feel like filling out a mountain of paperwork. Sometimes, all you need are a few carefully chosen words to spark a connection.

LoveJack profiles look like those on other blind-dating apps, but with a twist. Instead of blurred or hidden profiles, users see five words chosen by potential matches. When users press and hold on their phone screens (the app doesn’t use swiping mechanics), profile pictures are then revealed.

The five words can be anything from personal traits and jokes to current feelings or even random details, such as the ingredients in their lunch sandwich — an entertaining tactic that we saw one beta user try during our testing.

The idea is that the five-word constraint allows users to be creative while also challenging them to be concise and clever, encouraging more witty conversations and moving away from mundane questions like “What do you do for a living?” or overused pickup lines.

LeStage and Le decided to create LoveJack after being frustrated with the way online dating profiles often resemble job resumes — complete with posed photos, filters, and carefully crafted bios that can feel exaggerated.

“This is not LinkedIn. Where has the fun gone?” LeStage told TechCrunch, reflecting a sentiment shared bymany online daters, which may explain why dating giants likeTinderhave faced challenges in recent quarters.

LeStage got the idea while working as a judge for the Webby Awards, which notoriously limits winners to five-word speeches. The app also takes inspiration from The New York Times’popular Wordle game.

She shared with us that when she re-entered the dating scene, apps sucked the fun out of the experience, noting that traditional platforms emphasize superficial judgments based on appearance. So she decided to use the five-word challenge on her dates to spice things up, which helped her realize that people tended to use words that “advertised” their way of thinking.

“It’s the stories behind the words that matter,” LeStage explained. For instance, she spoke with someone who mentioned the word “disco.” When she asked him more about it, she discovered that he had written about the history of disco. “I was like, ‘Well, aren’t you Mr. Interesting?’” she said.

Other standout features include the options to either “Bet On” or “Hold” a match. Betting is similar to liking a profile, but the key difference is that users must place a bet by entering a five-word opening line. This gives the match something interesting to respond to.

Users are limited to a maximum of five matches per day, so they need to be strategic in their choices. This is where LoveJack’s “Hold” feature comes into play, allowing users to bookmark a profile if they’re unsure about someone.

Additionally, the five-word descriptions can be updated every day, adding a social aspect to the app. LoveJack archives all previous entries, allowing users to scroll through everything they’ve written.

“You can see in real time, day to day, how they’re revealing themselves through their five-word updates…Your story is going to change every day, all day, like your mood and the weather,” LeStage added.

In the future, there will also be a premium subscription that will include an “All In” button, the app’s version of a “Super Like,” but in this case, it’ll use all five bets on one person so they can’t match with anyone else for the rest of the day.

When it comes to unmatching someone, LoveJack says it tries to minimize ghosting by requiring users to write a preset message when they set up their profiles. The goodbye note is automatically sent to anyone they unmatch.

Another interesting aspect of LoveJack profiles is that users are encouraged to use fake names to protect their identities. While using pseudonyms on dating platforms is common, it can elicit mixed reactions from users. Some individuals may question the authenticity of potential matches, while others might prefer to keep their personal details private until they become more familiar with the other person.

LoveJack states that it implements a selfie verification process to confirm that the person behind the profile is indeed who they claim to be.

Other safety features include reporting and blocking capabilities, as well as censorship of banned language and explicit photos, and an emergency feature that enables users to contact the police and safety hotlines. (These features were unavailable during our beta testing but are expected to be included in the official version.)

LoveJack is set to launch its iOS app next month. It’ll launch in London first, with plans to roll out to U.S. markets next, including Boston, New York, San Francisco, and others. An Android version of the app will launch in India in late summer.

Technical,"To comply with the U.S.’restrictionson exporting advanced semiconductor technology to China, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD will soon begin selling new GPUs made for AI workloads in China, Taiwanese tech publicationDigiTimesreported, citing supply chain sources.

Nvidia plans to sell a stripped-down AI GPU, code-named “B20,” while AMD is looking to target AI workload needs with its new Radeon AI PRO R9700 workstation GPU, DigiTimes reported, adding that the companies will likely start selling these AI chips in China from July.

Earlier this week,Reutersreported that Nvidia is working on a new budget AI chip built on its Blackwell architecture for China that is expected to be priced at $6,500 to $8,000. In comparison, the company sells its H20 GPUs for $10,000 to $12,000 each.

Technical,"Home services in India — whether it is cleaning, dishwashing, or laundry — have traditionally been offline and informally run. This has often resulted in delays and uncertainties for consumers, as well as inconsistent pay and job insecurity for workers. Recently, however, startups havebegun viewing this area as ripe for transformation, leveraging technology to bring predictability, scalability, and structure to the space.

Snabbit, founded last year, is one of the early movers in this arena, enabling customers to book high-frequency home services, including cleaning, dishwashing, laundry, and kitchen preparation, through its app, with delivery as fast as 10 minutes. The startup has now raised $19 million in a Series B round led by Lightspeed, with participation from its existing investors Elevation Capital and Nexus Venture Partners, at a post-money valuation of $80 million to expand its presence.

The 15-month-old startup launched its quick-service platform in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, after founder and CEO Aayush Agarwal personally experienced the challenges of finding reliable home services. At one point, Agarwal told TechCrunch, the situation became so difficult that his mother had to fly in from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata to help him find a new domestic worker.

“What stayed with me was that in a world of convenience where you can press a button, and you’ll get a cab, or you’ll get food or groceries, you can even get someone to go out on a date with, but finding someone for a simple service at home was excruciatingly difficult,” he said in an interview.

The startup ran experiments early last year and remained in one micro market in Mumbai for the first 12 months before expanding to seven markets in the city and one in Bengaluru.

Snabbit took a “full-stack approach” to sourcing, screening, training, onboarding, and managing workers, who the startup calls “experts.” Once Snabbit signs them, it has the workers move close to the startup’s demand centers so they can fulfill the company’s promise to provide service in 10 minutes.

Snabbit is not alone in this race, as incumbentUrban Company(backed by storied investors, including Accel, Prosus, and Tiger Global)started a similar experienceon its app earlier this year. However, the company faced criticism due to the initial message it conveyed and the name Insta Maids, which it later corrected and renamed to Insta Help. This did not help convince many, including gig worker unions, though.

Similarly, newer entrants, includingBroomeesandPronto, have also joined the arena recently. The latter even recently attracted Bain Capital Ventures for its seed funding.

“We know that the market is heating up,” he said. “The category is getting exciting, new players are coming in and getting funded. And I think all of it is great for us as long as we keep executing relentlessly.”

The startup charges customers between ₹169 (about $2) and ₹499 (nearly $6) to avail services of up to 240 minutes. The pricing is higher than that of Urban Company’s Insta Help, which starts at ₹49 (50 cents). However, Agarwal said the startup continued to grow and scale even after Urban Company’s foray into the market.

Agarwal hopes to compete with a consistent customer experience using its in-house tech stack that includes an internal CRM tool, a sourcing and screening pipeline, and an eKYC process to better comply with local regulations.

Snabbit currently has over 600 workers on its platform, and each of them covers a median walking distance of 300 meters between two jobs. It has also partnered with the mobility startup Yulu to train and provide e-bikes to its women workers, covering a larger median distance of 800 meters between their jobs. Moreover, Agarwal told TechCrunch that the startup will reduce the median distance for its workers as it scales.

The average ticket size on Snabbit’s platform is between ₹250 and ₹270 (about $3), while its workers completing a 12-hour shift earn “upward” of ₹40,000 ($470) a month. For completing four hours a day on the platform, the workers get over ₹10,000 ($120) a month, Agarwal said, adding that workers are also eligible for bonuses.

Agarwal contends that workers can earn more than the roughly ₹9,000 ($100) that domestic helpers in urban locations are typically paid in the country,per the International Domestic Workers Federation (PDF).

Snabbit also provides personal life insurance, health insurance, and accidental insurance to all its workers, as well as family insurance to those who have been with the startup for some time.

Workplace abuse has also beenquite prevalent for domestic workers in India, as the countrypredominantly lacks protective laws. For such cases, the startup provides an SOS feature on its app that workers can use to call a field operations team, which reaches the location within “five to seven minutes” to help workers in edge situations, the founder said.

Over the last four months, Agarwal stated the startup grew 5x and is currently growing around 20% week-over-week. It plans to expand to over 200 micro markets across metro cities in India within the next nine months by utilizing the fresh capital and hire more employees in its workforce that has nearly 100 people.

That said, several hyperlocal consumer apps have been tried and failed repeatedly. For instance, food deliveries imploded globally in 2023 after the pandemic-led lockdowns eased, but they started facing challenges in the last few months. Even in India, instant food delivery models introduced by quick commerce platforms, includingZeptoandZomato, have struggled. The formerpaused its 10-minute cafe services due to supply constraints, while the latterhalted its 15-minute food delivery servicejust four months after launch, citing “no incrementality in demand.”

The cost of acquiring customers and providing suppliers in their location is expensive and often hard to pay over time. In Snabbit’s case, TechCrunch has learned that the customer acquisition cost is ₹700 ($8), while its average ticket size is about $3.

The startup has onboarded over 25,000 customers so far, and an average customer transacts on the platform at least three times a month, per Agarwal.

“Our retention rates are as good as any consumer internet company, say, a Zepto or Swiggy, would be having,” the executive said.

Nevertheless, it remains to be seen how the startup can retain its customers over time and beat the competition while continuing to scale and expand its market in India.

“Snabbit is transforming home services in India by bringing speed, structure, and trust to a sector that has largely operated informally until now,” said Rahul Taneja, a partner at Lightspeed, in a prepared statement. “We are excited to join them on this journey and support their mission to transform and scale what was once considered a luxury into a day-to-day necessity.”"
Technical,"Sahil Lavingia haspublished a diaryrecounting his time as a member ofElon Musk’s DOGE workforce. It’s a short read — Lavingia’s DOGE stint lasted just 55 days — but it does provide new details on the temporary government organization formed by President Trump’s executive order.

Lavingia is a well-known name in Silicon Valley, from his days as an early employee of Pinterest to his current gig as founder ofGumroad,a platform where creators can sell their goods. He’s also awell-known seed and angel investor.

He joined DOGE as a software engineer for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in mid-March, he wrote. What stands out from his account is his surprise that the 473,000-employee government agency had strict rules on who could be targeted in a layoff, and he quickly learned that all things at the VA were not as inefficient as he imagined. He also lamented that DOGE itself isn’t a well-oiled machine.

As a volunteer who had a salary of $0, he was immediately tasked with identifying “wasteful” contracts and the people the VA should lay off, he wrote. But he was surprised to discover facets like seniority and the person’s veteran status (this was the VA, after all) determined who could be targeted. Performance could be factored in lower on the list, in Lavingia’s view.

He also describedDOGE’s advisory roleas like a McKinsey management consultant and said DOGE is not responsible for the actions taken by the orgs. “DOGE had no direct authority. The real decisions came from the agency heads appointed by President Trump, who were wise to let DOGE act as the ‘fall guy’ for unpopular decisions,” he says.

This is similar to what Musk was decrying this week to theWashington Post. Musk describedDOGE as Washington, D.C.’s  “whipping boy,”blamed for every unpopular decision.

Lavingia said he joined DOGE after campaigning for Bernie Sanders in 2016 because he dreamed of writing code for the government that helped people at scale. Because his DOGE missives didn’t take much time, he said he worked on projects that interested him, including overhauling the UX of the VA’s already-in-use LLM-based chatbot.

He said he built a fairly long list of stuff in his less-than-two-month stint but didn’t get a chance to do enormous projects, like “improving the UX of veterans’ filing disability claims or automating/speeding up claims processing.”

And, he wrote, “I was never able to get approval to ship anything to production that would actually improve American lives — while also saving money for the American taxpayer.”

He was, however, given permission to open source much of his work. His work included a tool that scanned internal PDFs for terms “related to DEI, gender identity, COVID policies, climate initiatives, WHO partnerships,”he describedon the tool’s page, as well as tools that used LLMs to analyze contracts and a tool for building org charts.

He also made observations about the lack of organization in DOGE itself. “I wondered why there wasn’t a centralized DOGE software engineering playbook with all of our learnings; overall, I was surprised by the lack of knowledge-sharing within DOGE. It seemed like every engineer started from scratch.”

He was unceremoniously axed from DOGE on Day 55 after he discussedhis work there with a reporter from Fast Company. “I got the boot from DOGE,” he wrote. “Soon after publication, my access was revoked without warning.”

In that FC interview, however, he also said working up close with the VA taught him that, while it was slow like a giant enterprise, it still “works.”

“I would say the culture shock is mostly a lot of meetings, not a lot of decisions,” he says. “But honestly, it’s kind of fine — because the government works. It’s not as inefficient as I was expecting, to be honest. I was hoping for more easy wins.”

His experience captures perfectly the dilemma of keeping enormous government agencies modern as they remain functional. While all taxpayers would like less waste, and the government can surely benefit from more programmers immersed in the latest tech, perhaps Silicon Valley volunteers swooping in like they are building a startup from scratch isn’t the answer.

Technical,"Horizon3.ai, a cybersecurity startup that provides tools like autonomous penetration testing, is seeking to raise $100 million in a new funding round and has locked down at least $73 million, the company revealed inan SEC filingthis week.

NEA led the round, according to two people familiar with the deal. One person said that the startup is believed to be valued upward of $750 million, although TechCrunch couldn’t verify whether that valuation is pre- or post-money. Another person believes the company did (or will) sell the whole $100 million, and added that the company is generating about $30 million in annual recurring revenue. Neither Horizon nor NEA responded to TechCrunch’s requests for comment.

With this deal, Horizon3.ai becomes NEA’s second major cybersecurity startup investment in less than a month, following Veza’s $108 million funding round at an$800 million valuationannounced in April.

In August 2023, Horizon3.airaised $40 million in a Series C roundled by Craft Ventures with participation from SignalFire. That round brought the startup’s total fundraising to $78.5 million and was aimed to expand its R&D, channel presence, and team of engineers, co-founder CEO Snehal Antani told TechCrunch at the time.

Founded in 2019, Horizon3.ai comprises a team of former U.S. Special Operations cyber operators, entrepreneurs, and cybersecurity experts. Before launching the startup, Antani served as CTO at Splunk and led teams within the U.S. Military’s Joint Special Operations Command.

With all things AI being deployed across the tech world, AI-powered automated attacks are alsoon the rise. The San Francisco-based startup Horizon3.ai helps protect against such attacks with its autonomous threat detection tools.

Technical,"As Nvidia reports earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which closed on April 28, the company has released numbers on how the Trump administration’s recent chip-export restrictions are affecting business.

Nvidiareported that it incurred a $4.5 billion chargein Q1 due to licensing requirements impacting its ability to sell its H20 AI chip to companies in China. The chipmaker also reported that it was unable to ship an additional $2.5 billion of H20 revenue in the quarter due to the restrictions.

When the U.S. licensing requirement was originally announced in April, the companysaid that it expected $5.5 billion in related chargesfor Q1.

Nvidia also said Wednesday that the H20 licensing requirements will result in an $8 billion hit to the company’s revenue in Q2, which is predicted to be around $45 billion — a significant toll.

In the company’s Q1 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company is currently exploring ways to still compete in China’s AI market but that, for now, it has to take a write-off for its H20 chips.

“China is one of the world’s largest AI markets and a springboard to global success with half of the world’s AI researchers based there; the platform that wins China is positioned to lead globally today,” Huang said. “However, the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to us. The H20 export ban ended our Hopper data center business in China. We cannot reduce Hopper further to comply.”

Thecompany has been outspokenagainst the Trump administration’s push to limit the export of U.S.-made AI chips to countries, including China.Huang praisedtheadministration’s recent decision to scrap Joe Biden’s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rulethat would have imposed further chip-export restrictions.

DespiteBiden’s chip-export rules not coming to bear, Nvidia is clearly not immune to the Trump administration’s attempt to stifle China’s AI market.

“The question is not whether China will have AI; it already does,” Huang said. “The question is whether one of the world’s largest AI markets will run on American platforms. Shielding Chinese chip makers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America’s position.”

Co-sponsored by 17 other Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) responded to Trump’s increasing investment in crypto with the “End Crypto Corruption Act.”

“Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,” Senator Merkley said in apress release. “This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government.”

But without support across the aisle, these efforts to mitigate Trump’s ethically suspicious crypto investment are unlikely to gain momentum.

With the U.S. government on its side, bitcoin’s price has jumped to all-time highs in May, breaking the $110,000 mark after falling to around $75,000 in April. Companies likeTesla, Coinbase, and Blockhave already made large bitcoin purchases as a way of growing the company’s assets, with each holding over $1 billion worth of bitcoin.

Now, with its massive bitcoin purchase, GameStop follows in these companies’ footsteps."
Technical,"Three years ago, Stellantis announced it waspairing up with Amazonto create in-car software that would bring a slew of connected products and services to vehicles by 2024 as part of the automaker’s broader plan to generate $22.5 billion annually from software.

That never happened. And now the partnership is “winding down,”Reuters reported. The article also reported that Amazon staff working on the project had been reassigned or left the company, according to unnamed sources.

Stellantis confirmed the Reuters report and told TechCrunch it would be pivoting to an Android-based system.

“Amazon remains a valuable partner for Stellantis, and the companies continue to work together on a range of initiatives,” the automaker said in a statement. For instance, Stellantis will continue to use Amazon Web Services as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms. Amazon’s Alexa will also continue to be available in Stellantis vehicles.

Stellantis laid out an ambitious plan in December 2021 to have 34 million connected cars on the road by 2030. The pitch was that Stellantis would be setting itself up for a new stream of revenue beyond building and selling vehicles.

Stellantis struck partnerships with BMW, Foxconn, Waymo, and Amazon to reach that target.

The plan to use in-car software to sell passengers and drivers products and subscriptions involved three components.

It started with an underlying electrical and software architecture system that Stellantis dubbed STLA Brain. On top of the Brain, Stellantis would add a “STLA SmartCockpit,” a platform to deliver applications to the driver, such as navigation, voice assistance, an e-commerce marketplace, and payment services, as well as applications that would deliver personalized in-vehicle experiences for the driver and passengers. A third piece involved an automated driving platform called “AutoDrive,” developed with BMW.

Amazon wastapped to help Stellantiswith the STLA SmartCockpit, specifically with technology that would adapt to customers’ behaviors and interests and then deliver personalized services.

Stellantis told TechCrunch it is sticking with its smart cockpit platform. Now it seems Google’s Android-based system, which is used by numerous automakers, is headed to this future software platform."
Technical,"DeepSeek has gone viral.

Chinese AI lab DeepSeek broke into the mainstream consciousness this week afterits chatbot app rose to the top of the Apple App Store charts(and Google Play, as well). DeepSeek’s AI models, which were trained using compute-efficient techniques,have led Wall Street analysts—and technologists— to question whether the U.S. can maintain its lead in the AI race and whether the demand for AI chips will sustain.

But where did DeepSeek come from, and how did it rise to international fame so quickly?

DeepSeek is backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions.

AI enthusiastLiang Wenfengco-founded High-Flyer in 2015. Wenfeng, who reportedly began dabbling in trading while a student at Zhejiang University, launched High-Flyer Capital Management as a hedge fund in 2019 focused on developing and deploying AI algorithms.

In 2023, High-Flyer started DeepSeek as a lab dedicated to researching AI tools separate from its financial business. With High-Flyer as one of its investors, the lab spun off into its own company, also called DeepSeek.

From day one, DeepSeek built its own data center clusters for model training. But like other AI companies in China,DeepSeek has been affected by U.S. export bans on hardware. To train one of its more recent models, the company was forced to use Nvidia H800 chips, a less-powerful version of a chip, the H100, available to U.S. companies.

DeepSeek’s technical team is said to skew young. The companyreportedly aggressively recruitsdoctorate AI researchers from top Chinese universities.DeepSeek also hires people without any computer science backgroundto help its tech better understand a wide range of subjects, per The New York Times.

DeepSeek unveiled its first set of models — DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek LLM, and DeepSeek Chat — in November 2023. But it wasn’t until last spring, when the startup released its next-gen DeepSeek-V2 family of models, that the AI industry started to take notice.

DeepSeek-V2, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing system, performed well in various AI benchmarks — and was far cheaper to run than comparable models at the time. It forced DeepSeek’s domestic competition, including ByteDance and Alibaba, to cut the usage prices for some of their models, and make others completely free.

DeepSeek-V3, launched in December 2024, only added to DeepSeek’s notoriety.

According to DeepSeek’s internal benchmark testing, DeepSeek V3 outperforms both downloadable, openly available models like Meta’sLlamaand “closed” models that can only be accessed through an API, like OpenAI’sGPT-4o.

Equally impressive is DeepSeek’s R1 “reasoning” model. Released in January, DeepSeek claimsR1 performs as well as OpenAI’s o1 model on key benchmarks.

Being a reasoning model, R1 effectively fact-checks itself, which helps it to avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Reasoning models take a little longer — usually seconds to minutes longer — to arrive at solutions compared to a typical non-reasoning model. The upside is that they tend to be more reliable in domains such as physics, science, and math.

There is a downside to R1, DeepSeek V3, and DeepSeek’s other models, however. Being Chinese-developed AI, they’re subject tobenchmarkingby China’s internet regulator to ensure that its responses “embody core socialist values.” In DeepSeek’s chatbot app, for example, R1 won’t answer questions about Tiananmen Square or Taiwan’s autonomy.

In March,DeepSeek surpassed 16.5 million visits. “[F]or March, DeepSeek is in second place, despite seeing traffic drop 25% from where it was in February, based on daily visits,” David Carr, editor at Similarweb, told TechCrunch. It still pales in comparison to ChatGPT, which surged past 500 million weekly active users in March.

In May, DeepSeek released anupdated version of its R1 reasoning AI modelon the developer platform Hugging Face.

If DeepSeek has a business model, it’s not clear what that model is, exactly. The company prices its products and services well below market value — and gives others away for free.It’s also not taking investor money, despite a ton of VC interest.

The way DeepSeek tells it, efficiency breakthroughs have enabled it to maintain extreme cost competitiveness. Some expertsdisputethe figures the company has supplied, however.

Whatever the case may be, developers have taken to DeepSeek’s models, which aren’t open source as the phrase is commonly understood but are available under permissive licenses that allow for commercial use. According to Clem Delangue, the CEO of Hugging Face, one of the platforms hosting DeepSeek’s models,developers on Hugging Face have created over 500 “derivative” models of R1that have racked up 2.5 million downloads combined.

DeepSeek’s success against larger and more established rivals has beendescribed as “upending AI”and“over-hyped.”The company’s success was at least in part responsible forcausing Nvidia’s stock price to drop by 18%in January, and foreliciting a public responsefrom OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. In March, U.S. Commerce department bureaus told staffers thatDeepSeek will be banned on their government devices, according to Reuters.

Microsoftannounced that DeepSeek is available on its Azure AI Foundry service, Microsoft’s platform that brings together AI services for enterprises under a single banner. When asked about DeepSeek’s impact on Meta’s AI spending during its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg saidspending on AI infrastructure will continue to be a “strategic advantage”for Meta. In March,OpenAI called DeepSeek “state-subsidized” and “state-controlled,”and recommends that the U.S. government consider banning models from DeepSeek.

During Nvidia’s fourth-quarter earnings call,CEO Jensen Huang emphasized DeepSeek’s “excellent innovation,”saying that it and other “reasoning” models are great for Nvidia because they need so much more compute.

At the same time,some companies are banning DeepSeek, and so are entirecountriesandgovernments,including South Korea. New York state alsobanned DeepSeek from being used on government devices.

In May, Microsoft vice chairman and president Brad Smith said in a Senate hearing thatMicrosoft employees aren’t allowed to use DeepSeekdue to data security and propaganda concerns.

As for what DeepSeek’s future might hold, it’s not clear. Improved models are a given. But the U.S. government appears to begrowing wary of what it perceives as harmful foreign influence. In March, The Wall Street Journal reported thatthe U.S. will likely ban DeepSeek on government devices.

This story was originally published January 28, 2025, and will be updated regularly."
Technical,"Chinese startup DeepSeek has released an updated version of itsR1 reasoning AI modelon thedeveloper platform Hugging Faceafter announcing it in a WeChat message Wednesday morning.

The updated R1, which is under a permissive MIT license, meaning it can be used commercially, is a “minor” upgrade, according to DeepSeek’s WeChat announcement. The Hugging Face repository doesn’t contain a description of the model — only configuration files and weights, the internal components of a model that guide its behavior.

Weighing in at 685 billion parameters in size, the updated R1 is quite hefty. (“Parameters” is synonymous with “weights.”) Without modification, the model likely can’t run on consumer-grade hardware.

DeepSeek rose to prominence earlier this yearfollowing the release of R1, which gave models from OpenAI a run for their money. The startup hasraised the ireof some regulators stateside, who argue that DeepSeek’s technology poses a national security risk."
Technical,"Karat Financial, the companyknown for its credit cards for creators, is launching a creator-focused business banking product. Powered by digital bankGrasshopper, Karat’s banking product is a natural extension of its credit card offering with Visa.

“Six years in, the problem we’re solving is still the same,” co-founder and co-CEO Eric Wei told TechCrunch. “Creators are real businesses, and banks don’t understand them.”

Despite their prominent position in culture, creators still encounter hiccups when doing simple things like applying for a business credit card or opening up a bank account, even when their businesses are booming.

In some cases, Wei has seen creators who make millions of dollars a year get declined when making $100 purchases at department stores. In more ambitious cases, Wei sawWilliam Osman, a creator with over 3 million YouTube subscribers, fail to get the six figures in credit he needed to put on theOpen Sauceconvention.

Karat stepped in, gave Osman the credit, and soon got paid back.

“This was a no-brainer, but a normal institution just does not understand the nature of their business,” Wei said.

To date, Karat has extended $1.5 billion in credit, with the average credit limit per creator at $25,000. But creators needed more financial services beyond the Karat Visa.

“As this business-oriented side of the entire creator industry grows, we’re no longer just working with YouTubers who are like, ‘Oh my God, what are taxes?’” Wei said. “We’re also working with entrepreneurs who are like, ‘Why is this so hard for me to get proper treatment from a bank?’”

For business banking, Karat offers two tiers — one is a free, FDIC-insured business checking account with automated tax planning (most creators are independent contractors, so they have to prepare more intentionally for their tax payments than if they had a more traditional full-time job).

The premium offering costs $20 per month or requires a $35,000 minimum balance, but provides 2% to 3% APY on checking accounts, free wires, and enhanced customer support, with AI bookkeeping coming soon.

“We know creators actually keep a lot of money in their checking account because the industry is so unstable, so we pay meaningful APY on checking, which most banks actually don’t do,” Wei said. “We have to balance that with knowledge on the banking side of working with a banking partner and helping them understand, ‘Oh, these are really valuable creators and customers to bring on.’”

In the future, Karat hopes to continue this trajectory of offering more and more business services for creators that traditional institutions are reluctant to provide. A possible avenue could be offering various types of insurance to creators, including healthcare for their companies.

“We’re basically trying to reconstruct the financial safety net for people who make money themselves,” said Wei."
Technical,"Odyssey, a startup founded by self-driving pioneersOliver CameronandJeff Hawke, has developed an AI model that lets users “interact” with streaming video.

Available on the web in an “early demo,” the model generates and streams video frames every 40 milliseconds. Via basic controls, viewers can explore areas within a video, similar to a 3D-rendered video game.

“Given the current state of the world, an incoming action, and a history of states and actions, the model attempts to predict the next state of the world,”explains Odyssey in a blog post. “Powering this is a new world model, demonstrating capabilities like generating pixels that feel realistic, maintaining spatial consistency, learning actions from video, and outputting coherent video streams for 5 minutes or more.”

A number of startups and Big Tech companies are chasing afterworld models, includingDeepMind, influential AI researcher Fei-Fei Li’sWorld Labs,Microsoft, andDecart. They believe that world models could one day be used to create interactive media, such as games and movies, and run realistic simulations like training environments for robots.

But creatives have mixed feelings about the tech. ArecentWired investigation found that game studios like Activision Blizzard, which has laid off scores of workers, are using AI to cut corners and combat attrition. And a 2024studycommissioned by the Animation Guild, a union representing Hollywood animators and cartoonists, estimated that over 100,000 U.S.-based film, television, and animation jobs will be disrupted by AI in the coming months.

For its part, Odyssey is pledging to collaborate with creative professionals — not replace them.

“Interactive video … opens the door to entirely new forms of entertainment, where stories can be generated and explored on demand, free from the constraints and costs of traditional production,” writes the company in its blog post. “Over time, we believe everything that is video today — entertainment, ads, education, training, travel, and more — will evolve into interactive video, all powered by Odyssey.”

Odyssey’s demo is a bit rough around the edges, which the company acknowledges in its post. The environments the model generates are blurry and distorted, and unstable in the sense that their layouts don’t always remain the same. Walk forward in one direction for a while or turn around, and the surroundings might suddenly look different.

But the company’s promising to rapidly improve upon the model, which can currently stream video at up to 30 frames per second from clusters of Nvidia H100 GPUs at the cost of $1 to $2 per “user-hour.”

“Looking ahead, we’re researching richer world representations that capture dynamics far more faithfully, while increasing temporal stability and persistent state,” writes Odyssey in its post. “In parallel, we’re expanding the action space from motion to world interaction, learning open actions from large-scale video.”

Odyssey is taking a different approach than many AI labs in the world modeling space. It designed a360-degree, backpack-mounted camera systemto capture real-world landscapes, which Odyssey thinks can serve as a basis for higher-quality models than models trained solely on publicly available data.

To date, Odyssey has raised $27 million from investors, including EQT Ventures, GV, and Air Street Capital. Ed Catmull, one of the co-founders of Pixar and former president of Walt Disney Animation Studios, is on the startup’s board of directors.

Last December, Odysseysaidit was working on software that allows creators to load scenes generated by its models into tools such as Unreal Engine, Blender, and Adobe After Effects so that they can be hand-edited."
Technical,"Spotify on Wednesday announced a handful of new features designed to give podcasts a more prominent position in its app as it battles with Apple and YouTube to become users’ preferred podcast streaming destination.

The company says it will begin recommending podcasts on its Home page and provide a Following feed for staying up-to-date with the latest episodes of your favorite shows. Soon, Spotify will also roll out new tools for podcast creators to recommend content and better engage with their fans in comments.

The changes, while relatively minor, are a part of Spotify’s growing efforts to compete with Apple’s Podcasts app and YouTube. The latter has been investing more heavily in podcasts in recent years. This month, for instance, YouTube launched itsown weekly top podcast listto challenge Spotify and Apple. That chart highlights somemajor differences between the platformsin terms of what YouTube’s video viewers prefer to watch.

Meanwhile, Spotify has also invested in video podcasts,allowing all creators to upload videoandincentivizing them with paymentsfor successful showsthrough its Partner Program.

Despite these efforts, YouTube remains the service to beat in the U.S., at least, where one-third of weekly podcast listeners prefer the Google-owned service to Spotify or Apple.

Spotify says the new podcast recommendations on the Home tab have already started to roll out to global users, and early feedback suggests it’s led to more users engaging with podcasts, saving, and liking shows.

In addition, Spotify is introducing a Following feed that will serve as a dedicated spot where you can see all the latest episodes released by the podcasts you follow, instead of having to search across the app. (To access this feature, you’ll tap on the Podcasts button at the top of the app, then the Following button that appears to its right.)

Podcast creators will soon gain access to a new feature that lets them point to other content they mention in their podcast episode that can also be found on Spotify — including other podcasts, songs, audiobooks, playlists, and more. This will become available over the next few weeks and will be found on the episode page.

In a smaller tweak, creators who participate in the comments of their podcast pages on the app will be able to use emoji reactions to respond to fans.

The company notes that creators are still able to control when comments appear or opt out of showing them on their shows or episode pages via their Spotify for Creators account."
Technical,"Google is celebrating 10 years of Google Photoswith the launch of a redesigned editor. The redesign adds new AI features — Reimagine and Auto Frame — which were previously only available on Pixel devices, bringing the tools into the hands of more users.

The Reimagine feature uses generative AI to transform objects and backgrounds in photos with text prompts. For example, you could ask to replace a gloomy sky in one of your photos with “clear blue skies.”

The Auto Frame feature suggests different ways to frame a photo, whether it’s by cropping, widening, or using generative AI to fill in the blank spaces.

Google says the new editor gives users helpful suggestions and puts all its editing tools in one place. You can use AI-powered suggestions that combine multiple effects for quick edits with the new “AI Enhance” option. For example, you could combine AI effects like image sharpening and object removal.

Or, you can tap specific parts of a photo to get suggested tools for editing that area. For example, Google may suggest that you adjust the lighting or blur the background.

Google notes the redesign will start rolling out globally to Android devices next month, with iOS following later this year.

The tech giant also announced that you can now share albums with QR codes to make it easier for others around you to access an album. You could also print out the codes for a group event, where anyone with the code will be able to view and add photos to the album."
Technical,"Meta wants to grow its retail footprint, Business Insiderreportedon Wednesday.

As Meta continues to invest in wearables, these stores would ideally help Meta boost the sales of hardware like theRay-Ban Meta glassesand the Meta Quest VR headsets. These products may be easier to sell if customers can try them out at a store before buying them.

A retail presence could also help Meta stay in competition with Apple’s future AR and VR endeavors, even though itsVision Proheadset is too costly for most consumers.

Hastings’ appointment adds a veteran Big Tech executive to one of OpenAI’s largest — and youngest — competitors in the AI race. The Netflix co-founder seems likely to help Anthropic grow from a startup into a major company, pulling from his experience sitting on the boards of Netflix, Microsoft, Bloomberg, and Meta.

However, Anthropic notes that Hastings was appointed by its Long-Term Benefit Trust, an independent body at the top of the startup’s corporate governance structure that’s designed to be “financially disinterested.” The Long-Term Benefit Trust can appoint and remove board members, with the ultimate goal of helping Anthropic develop AI for the long-term benefit of humanity.

Hastings joins Anthropic’s existing board members: co-founders Dario and Daniela Amodei; investor Yasmin Razavi; and the CEO of Confluent, Jay Kreps."
Technical,"AMD has acquiredEnosemi, a startup designing custom materials to support silicon photonics product development. The terms of the deal, announced Wednesday, weren’t disclosed.

Silicon photonics uses light — photons — to transmit data, offering a faster and more efficient alternative to traditional electrical communication. AMD and other chipmakers have shown an increasing interest in the tech. Late last year, AMDreportedlyteamed up with several Taiwan startups for a silicon photonics R&D collaboration.

AMD says that its acquisition of Enosemi will “accelerate [its] co-packaged optics innovation for AI systems.”

“As AI models grow larger and more complex, the need for faster, more efficient data movement is accelerating,” Brian Amick, SVP of tech and engineering at AMD, wrote in ablog post. “Enosemi has collaborated with us as an external development partner on photonics, and this acquisition extends that successful relationship. Now, as part of AMD, the team will help us immediately scale our ability to support and develop a variety of photonics and co-packaged optics solutions across next-gen AI systems.”

Enosemi, based in Silicon Valley, builds and ships photonic integrated circuits — microchips containing two or more photonic components that form a functioning circuit. Founded in 2023 by a group of tech entrepreneurs, including Ari Novack and Matthew Streshinsky, both of whom have a background in semiconductor engineering, Enosemi offers products such as optical interconnects, which integrate computing and networking components inside a data center.

Prior to its exit, Enosemi raised $150,000 in VC funding from backers,includingNew Mexico Vintage Fund. The company had 16 employees as of May,according to PitchBook.

Novack’sLinkedIn profilenow lists him as a silicon design engineering fellow at AMD.

Enosemi is AMD’s first acquisition following the company’s massive deal to buy ZT Systems, for which the former originally paid around $4.9 billion. (AMD reached anagreementto sell ZT Systems’ server-manufacturing business for $3 billion earlier this month.)

The company is doubling down on its AI investments; in 2024, AMD’s AI chip revenue reached $5 billion, CEO Lisa Su saidduring an earnings callin February."
Technical,"Tesla’s Cybertruck sales dropped significantly in recent quarters, leading to a rapid buildup of unsold inventory. And it looks like the company is resorting to unconventional storage sites for the excess vehicles.

One such location, perCrains Detroit Business, is a Detroit shopping center that is now in violation of city code for storing dozens of Cybertrucks and other unsold Teslas in its parking lot.

No doubt the parking lot looks like a dystopian graveyard with rows upon rows of shiny silver Cybertrucks taking up space where shoppers once came to visit the now-closed Bed Bath & Beyond and Torrid. The Buffalo Wild Wings in the shopping center, though, is still open.

The lot is near a new Tesla showroom in West Bloomfield, which may account for the overflow. Crain’s reports that the shopping center landlord has been informed of the violation, but enforcement could take some time.

But that Silicon Valley culture continues to seep into policy as tech billionairesexpand their influence in Washington, making these tensions harder to ignore. Elon Musk spent nearly $300 million to elect Donald Trump, and now holds sway over the federal agencies that regulate his businesses and award government contracts. And he’s not alone. Peter Thiel, Marc Andreessen, and Palmer Luckey have also built powerful networks that now reach deep into policymaking circles.

Technical,"Over three and a half years after family locator app Life360acquired lost item tracker Tile for $205 million, the two services are finallyfully integrated. On Wednesday, Life360 announced that the item-finding capabilities of Tile, a competitor to Apple’s AirTag and other Bluetooth-based trackers, are now available from inside its main app.

The update means users will now be able to see where family members are in real time, as well as their valuables, like their wallet, keys, bags, and other items. The change will also help to centralize the separate user bases for the two apps by pushing Tile’s users to adopt the Life360 app as their main tracking tool.

A company representative told TechCrunch that the integrated services will begin rolling out on Wednesday and will reach all users over the next few weeks.

As the rollout progresses, Tile users will soon see a message in their app directing them to Life360, while Life360 users will see a new section for tracking their items below the people and pets section on the Location tab of the app.

Tiles that are with a Life360 family member will also appear on the in-app map in real time. If an item is lost, users can view up to two days of location history for free. Subscription plan users can access longer periods of location history, with Gold and Platinum users able to see 30 days, while Silver members can access the past seven days. Silver members also now have access to emergency dispatch services through the Tile SOS button or the Life360 app. (This works with the 2024 Tile devices only, however.)

In addition, Life360 users will soon be able to receive automatic push notifications when their items attached to Tile devices are left behind. The company says to expect this functionality to arrive in the weeks ahead.

Just ahead of this update, Life360redirectedtheTile.comdomain toLife360.com.

The company hasn’t yet given an indication if or when it plans to wind down the standalone Tile app, and it likely won’t want to make that move until it’s able to migrate users over to its flagship product. But after Tile functionality is fully replicated in Life360’s app, it may no longer make sense to continue to run both applications. (Reached for comment, a spokesperson said the Tile app is not being retired “at this time.”)

Life360 had saidback in2022that it would integrate Tile into its main app, noting at the time that if all its Life360 users joined Tile, it would become the largest finding network. But that opportunity may have passed, given the delay in integrating the services. Plus, competitors likeChipolo have since launched their own lost-item trackersthat work directly with both Apple and Google’s own built-in finding networks out of the box.

Life360 doesn’t share the number of users for its Tile app, but notes that its flagship product has 83.7 million global monthly active users, 45.3 million of whom are based in the U.S."
Technical,"Microsoftannouncedon Wednesday that it has started rolling out the beta version of its Copilot for Gaming experience. Beta testers can access the experience in the Xbox app on iOS and Android.

The early version of the experience allows the assistant to answer questions about the games you’re interested in, give you links to more information, and answer questions based on your account, play history, achievements, and more.

For example, you could ask something like: “What’s my gamer score and can you give me some tips to raise it?” or “I love horror movies. Any suggestions for what game I should play?” As for questions about your play history or account, you could ask something like: “What was the last achievement I got in Starfield?” or “When does my Game Pass subscription renew?”

“In this early version of the feature for mobile, you’ll be able to access Copilot for Gaming on a second screen, without distracting you from your core gameplay experience,” Taylor O’Malley, principal program manager at Xbox, explained in ablog post.

Once you ask Copilot a question, it looks at your player activity on Xbox, alongside public information from Bing, to formulate a response. Microsoft says it’s working to add more personalization and richer game assistance, such as proactive coaching, to Copilot for Gaming.

The beta version of Copilot for Gaming is available in English for players aged 18 and older in the following countries: Albania, Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkiye, UAE, Ukraine, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam.

Technical,"Context, a startup building an AI-powered office suite, on Wednesday announced that it raised $11 million in a seed round led by Lux Capital with participation from Qualcomm Ventures and General Catalyst. The round, whichbrings the company’s total raisedto around $15.75 million, values Context at $70 million.

Founder Joseph Semrai, a Thiel Fellow, started working on Context in 2024 after he realized that current digital office suites are not well-suited to take advantage of AI models.

“[W]e have a bunch of disparate applications that aren’t necessarily built keeping the power of [AI models] in mind,” Semrai told TechCrunch in a phone interview. “We want to take advantage of the fact that [models] can understand large context windows and use multiple applications at the same time to get the best result.”

Over the past few years, many startups inthe productivityandbrowsing spacehave made user interface changes to adopt a chat-forward experience, largely thanks to the rise of AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT. Semrai thinks that Context, which is similarly chat-focused, can be a powerful tool for workers using an office suite, similar to how Cursor has become a useful application for programmers.

Office suite makers likeGoogleandMicrosofthave infused AI into their applications. Canva, which has been in the creative space historically, is also designing products that suit all kinds of office work withAI at the center. Notion, meanwhile, is buildingan enterprise workplace with an AI search and research mode.

Many of these products offer connectors to third-party applications. But Semrai said that while connecting to sources and retrieving data is becoming commoditized, new-age tools don’t always deliver capabilities that help with analysis. That, he said, is where Context comes in — it’s designed to make it easier for users to reason over the data they fetch from various sources and make decisions based on that.

Context has a simple interface with a chat box in the center. You can ask the AI tool to perform research derived from your documents, integrations, and web knowledge. You can then ask it to convert all this to a document, spreadsheet, or presentation, while continuing to interact with it to generate different artifacts.

Context also offers a Python interpreter to let you run code.

The goal isn’t necessarily replacing a fully featured office suite like Microsoft 365. Rather, Context is going after a market not well-served by the current crop of tools, according to Semrai. For example, unlike many AI-powered data analysis products, Context will soon be able to work offline, enabling simple analysis and document drafting based on existing data and documents via Context’s desktop client.

“The general ledger is the beating heart of the finance function, and so asking a company to remove it is a kind of open-heart surgery,” said Julien Bek, a partner at Sequoia Capital.

Until a few years ago, Bek believed that VCs wouldn’t dare to invest in startups building new general ledger software. It’s not only difficult to get customers to switch from their existing accounting software, but building a new general ledger business is also very challenging, he explained.

Bek changed his mind when he discoveredRillet, a three-year-old company leveraging machine learning and generative AI to automate accounting reports. Rillet directly pulls data from their customers’ banks and platforms, such as Salesforce, Stripe, Ramp, Brex, and Rippling, to generate essential financial statements, including the balance sheet and income statement.

Rillet founder Nicolas Kopp (pictured above) says thanks to machine learning and AI, his company’s software enables accounting and finance teams at medium-sized companies to close their monthly or quarterly books in hours, a process that previously took weeks. Prior to Rillet, Kopp was U.S. CEO of Europeanneobank N26.

Since launching its product last year, Rillet’s revenue has grown five-fold, and it has brought on nearly 200 customers, including fast-growing companies like Windsurf, the AI coding assistantreportedly sold to OpenAI for $3 billion, and Decagon, an AI customer support startup reportedly valued at $1.6 billion.

In the past, companies of that size would likely have installed NetSuite, general ledger software developed in the late 1990s that is still very popular with middle-sized companies. But NetSuite is slow and clunky.

“I think a third of their deals are coming from [customers] replacing NetSuite, or NetSuite-like systems,” Bek said about Rillet’s customers.

It was this statistic that helped Sequoia decide to invest. “What I was watching for is that they start replacing NetSuite. Because [with] many companies, you can get the small customers, but getting the big ones, I think that’s really hard,” Bek said.

On Wednesday, Rillet said it has raised a $25 million Series A led by Sequoia Capital, with participation from existing investors. The fresh funding comes 10 months after the company raised a $13.5 million seed and pre-seed round from First Round Capital, Creandum, and Susa Ventures.

Rillet’s AI makes the installation process relatively painless. It used to take many months to transfer all the data from one general ledger software to another; Rillet can reduce that time to about four to six weeks, Kopp said. Clients simply continue to use the existing general ledger platform until they are sure that all the data has moved to Rillet.

According to Kopp, Rillet competes with NetSuite and other legacy platforms, but currently doesn’t have a clear rival that leverages AI and machine learning to replace accounting systems for mid-size companies.Digits, another AI accounting startup, recently launched its autonomously-powered general ledger, but unlike Rillet, it targets small businesses that use QuickBooks and Xero."
Technical,"After the market closes on Wednesday, Nvidia will report earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026, which ended on April 27.

While many in the industry are likely eager to hear how the recentwhiplash surrounding U.S. chip export controlswill impact Nvidia’s international chip business and future guidance, not everyone thinks that is the most important piece of Nvidia’s results to pay attention to.

Kevin Cook, a senior equity strategist at Zacks Investment Research who has followed Nvidia for a decade, told TechCrunch he believes the company’s rollout of its new GB200 NVL72 hardware — a single-rack exascale computer that started shipping in February — is a much more important area for shareholders to focus on.

TheseGB200 NVL72 machinesinclude 72 GPUs and cost around $3 million. Cook said that, despite strong demand and high expectations heading into this year, thechaos around DeepSeekin late January sparked manyanalysts to halve their delivery estimates for the unit.

Cook added that, because this is the first quarter the company has shipped the machine, there isn’t yet a clear indicator of how things are going.

“If Jensen [Huang] says we are going to deliver 10,000 units in Q2, the street will be very impressed,” Cook said. “That’s a big doable number; 10,000 is $30 billion on a $3 million product. I think they are going to do less than 5,000.”

Cook added that these results will start to paint a picture of enterprise appetite for the latest AI tech. Will companies upgrade their AI hardware each time a new system comes out, similar to how consumers upgrade to the latest iPhone each year? Cook isn’t sure. Whether or not enterprises will adopt that behavior could have a significant impact on Nvidia down the line.

There will be immediate effects on Nvidia’s stock based on what the company says regarding U.S. export controls, Cook predicted. But he doesn’t think it will impact Nvidia’s valuation or stock price long term in the same way that demand for the GB200 NVL72 might.

Nvidia’s stock price has proven it can recover from short-term market reactions, he added.

“We basically had a flash crash, and it’s right back up,” Cook said regarding Nvidia’s stock price after the chipexport restrictions were announced. “That’s unique to Nvidia. Lots of companies are going to have hiccups, but Nvidia has the biggest moat. They have the most resilience to any of this. It’s such an irony that they could have this issue with China — whether or not they can sell — and it basically gets shrugged off, right?”

Even if chip export restrictions on China remain or become more stringent, Cook argued that Nvidia isn’t struggling to find customers elsewhere. The company currently sells to all the major hyperscalers and will likely continue to see strong demand for its AI chips. He added that the recent announcements regardingStargate’s new project in the Middle Eastwill likely be another win for the company.

For Cook, his guidance really comes down to those GB200 NVL72 units.

“As long as we hear that deliveries are expected to be steady to exceptional, then whatever fluctuations in this quarter’s revenue, I think, are going to be put on the back burner because the wind is in their sails for the rest of the year,” Cook said."
Technical,"Discordannouncedon Wednesday that it’s experimenting with a new virtual reward system aimed at encouraging more users to engage with its interactive ads. This new feature, called “Orbs,” comes on the heels of the company preparing for apotential IPO.

Users can earn Orbs by completing “Quests,” Discord’s ad format where advertisers incentivize users to watch product videos or play games by rewarding them with virtual items. The addition of Orbs gives users the chance to redeem exclusive digital items from Discord’s Shop, including Nitro credits, profile badges, avatar decorations, profile effects, and items from main collections.

It’s clear that the goal of Orbs is to encourage more interaction with Quests as Discord seeks to demonstrate to partners that it can offer a scalable ad business. The company has reportedly discussed a possible IPO with investment bankers, perThe New York Times.

Last month,Peter Sellis, Discord’s senior vice president of product, highlighted the success of Quests. He reported that, over the past year, more than 70 Quests achieved a 10% acceptance rate with millions of rewards earned, according to the company’s internal data.

Quests are located in the bottom left corner of the app on PC. Plans are in place toexpand Quests to mobile devicesin June.

The Orbs experiment may also entice users who don’t have a subscription to try Nitro, as they can spend Orbs on credits instead of using a payment method. For instance, users need 1,400 Orbs to get three free days of Nitro, which typically costs $10 per month.

Orbs is being rolled out to a small group of users and will soon expand globally.

This story was updated to clarify that Quests are not available on gaming consoles."
Technical,"With Apple’s flagship Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) event a few weeks away, the company is signaling that it’s paying attention to the opportunity of mobile gaming.

Apple already has a subscription-based Arcade product for iOS, which gives users access to various mobile games, including cult-classic indie games like Stardew Valley. But per a Digital Trends report, the company is taking things a step further byacquiring its first game studio, RAC7, which makes the hit Apple Arcade game Sneaky Sasquatch.

Apple joins some other seemingly unlikely suspects in their investment in mobile gaming — Netflix, for example, acquiredseveral gaming studiosafter launchingNetflix Gamesin 2021, which makes cloud mobile gaming available to Netflix subscribers.

Meanwhile, Bloombergconfirmeda 9to5Macreportthat Apple is developing a dedicated gaming app for iOS 19. The app will reportedly replace the Game Center app and integrate with Apple Arcade to host features like gaming leaderboards, recommendations, challenges, and social features. The new app could also integrate into iMessage or FaceTime to facilitate remote multiplayer gaming.

Apple’s additional investment in mobile gaming comes at a time when cloud gaming — which allows users to stream games to their devices without downloading massive files — is on the rise. Microsoft has been a leader in this shift with its Xbox Cloud Gaming offerings."

Technical,"LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a data broker that collects and uses consumers’ personal data to help its paying corporate customers detect possible risk and fraud, has disclosed a data breach affecting more than 364,000 people.

The company said ina filing with Maine’s attorney generalthat the breach, dating back to December 25, 2024, allowed a hacker to obtain consumers’ sensitive personal data from a third-party platform used by the company for software development.

Jennifer Richman, a spokesperson for LexisNexis, told TechCrunch that an unknown hacker accessed the company’s GitHub account.

The stolen data varies, but includes names, dates of birth, phone numbers, postal and email addresses, Social Security numbers, and driver license numbers.

It’s not immediately clear what circumstances led to the breach. Richman said LexisNexis received a report on April 1, 2025 “from an unknown third party claiming to have accessed certain information.” The company would not say if it had received a ransom demand from the hacker.

Data brokers like LexisNexis are part of a billion-dollar industry of companies that profit from collecting and selling access to large amounts of Americans’ personal and financial data. LexisNexis uses swathes of consumer information to help companies detect potentially fraudulent transactions, as well as to perform risk assessment and due diligence on would-be customers.

Last year,The New York Timesreported that car manufacturers were among several companies that shared data on vehicle driving habits with LexisNexis without car owners’ explicit permission. The data was then sold on to insurance companies, which used the mileage and driving data to determine the drivers’ insurance premiums.

Law enforcement agencies also use LexisNexis for obtaining personal information on suspects, such asnames, home addresses, and call records.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration scrapped a plan that would haverestricted data brokers from selling Americans’ personal and financial information, including Social Security numbers. White House official Russell Vought wrote in a Federal Register notice that the Biden-era rule, which would have required data brokers to follow the same federal privacy rules as credit bureaus and renter-screening companies, was “not necessary or appropriate,” despite long-standing calls by privacy advocates to close the loophole.

Technical,"Instacart announced on Wednesday that its chief business officer, Chris Rogers, has been appointed as the company’s new CEO. The appointment is effective August 15. Rogers will also join Instacart’s board of directors.

The announcement comes a few weeks after Instacart CEOFidji Simoshared that she’s stepping down tojoin OpenAI as CEO of Applications. Simo will remain chair of the board at Instacart.

In his role as chief business officer, Rogers oversaw Instacart’s retailer relationships and expansions, Ad Sales and R&D, Partnerships, Mergers & Acquisitions, Instacart Business, and Instacart Health.

Rogers joined Instacart in 2019 after nearly 11 years at Apple, where he served as the managing director for Apple Canada. He began his career at Procter & Gamble, where he led relationships with Canada’s largest national grocery retailers, Instacart says.

“Instacart sits at the center of how people shop, eat, and care for their families — and that’s always been what inspires me most about our mission,” Rogers said in apress release. “Together with our partners, we’re transforming the future of grocery shopping, but more importantly, we’re helping people solve real, everyday needs. We have a world-class team, deep partnerships, leading technology, and a bold vision for the future, and I’m honored to step in and lead Instacart’s next chapter.”

In ablog post, Rogers said that Instacart’s vision will remain the same under his leadership, and that the company will continue to focus on its “unwavering commitment to growing the pie for retailers and brands.” He also said that Instacart will work to provide more flexible earnings opportunities for shoppers on its platform.

In a letter to employees, Simo stated that Rogers has played a critical role in shaping Instacart and that she will continue to work with him over the coming months to allow for a smooth transition.

“We chose Chris because the company needs a leader who understands all our partners deeply, has immense operational experience, and can mobilize teams around our vision,” Simo wrote. “Chris knows this company. He helped shape it. And I know Chris will carry our mission forward with conviction, care, and ambition. I couldn’t be more excited for him to step into the role of CEO and lead Instacart’s next phase of growth.”"
Technical,"Tech companies arebetting heavilythat nuclear power can help deliver the electricity they need to realize their AI plans. But data centers need power tomorrow, and the nuclear industry isn’t known for its speed.

Trey Lauderdale thinks AI can give nuclear the speed that it needs.

Lauderdale’s obsession with nuclear started close to home. In San Luis Obispo, California, where he lives, he kept running into people who worked at the Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “They’re like the coaches of our flag football team,” he said.

In talking with them, he learned that nuclear power plants are swimming in documents. Diablo Canyon has around 2 billion pages’ worth, he said. Lauderdale, a serial healthcare entrepreneur, had a hunch that AI could help the nuclear industry tame its paper problem.

Lauderdale foundedAtomic Canyona little over a year and a half ago, initially funding it with his own money. The startup uses AI to help engineers, maintenance technicians, and compliance officers find the documents they need.

The startup landed a deal with Diablo Canyon in late 2024. Lauderdale said the deal led to inquiries from other nuclear power companies. “That’s when I knew, as an entrepreneur, we were at a point where we needed to raise a round of capital.”

Atomic Canyon closed a $7 million seed round led by Energy Impact Partners, the company exclusively told TechCrunch. Participating investors include Commonweal Ventures, Plug and Play Ventures, Tower Research Ventures, Wischoff Ventures, and previous angel investors.

When Atomic Canyon first started, its AI engineers tested various models with underwhelming results. “We quickly realized the AI hallucinates when it sees these nuclear words,” Lauderdale said. “It hasn’t seen enough examples of the acronyms.”

But building a new AI model requires massive computing power. So Lauderdale talked his way into a meeting with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which conducts nuclear research and also happens to have the world’s second-fastest supercomputer. The lab was intrigued by the idea and awarded Atomic Canyon 20,000 GPU hours’ worth of compute.

Atomic Canyon’s models use sentence embedding, which is particularly suited to indexing documents. It tasks them with making a nuclear power plant’s documents searchable using retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG. RAG uses large language models to create responses to queries, but it requires the LLMs to refer to specific documents in an effort to reduce hallucination.

For now, Atomic Canyon is sticking to document search, in part because the stakes are lower.

“One of the reasons we’re starting generative work around the titles of documents is because getting that wrong might cause someone a little frustration. It doesn’t put anyone at risk at the plant,” Lauderdale said.

Eventually, Lauderdale envisions Atomic Canyon’s AI creating “a first round draft” of documents, complete with references. “You are always going to have a human in the loop here,” he said.

Lauderdale didn’t put a timeline on that effort, though. Search is “the foundational layer,” he said. “You have to nail the search.” Plus, given the number of documents in the nuclear industry, “we have a long runway in search alone,” he said."
Technical,"Elon Musk’s brain implant startup, Neuralink, has raised $600 million in a funding round that values the company at $9 billion pre-money,Semafor reported, citing anonymous sources.

Semafor did not mention the investors involved in the round. Neuralink lastraised $43 millionin venture capital in November 2023, and was valued at about $5 billion in June 2023, Reutersreportedat the time.

Technical,"All Thibault Launay and his wife, Simi, wanted nearly five years ago was to build a dream home in Portugal, where they both now live.

But what they encountered instead was a broken system. “Fourteen months of delays, 20% budget overruns, and endless stress managing over 10 subcontractors,” Thibault recalled. They bought the land in December 2020, got the construction license in early 2022, and started building that year. “That was supposed to finish in February 2024,” he said. But it’s May 2025, and the home still isn’t done.

“We realized,” he continued, “if we’re struggling with this, so are millions of others.”

So Thibault, himself a serial founder and entrepreneur, and Simi, a consultant and also a founder, launchedLitehaus, a company that touts to help landowners and property developers build homes in a more efficient and sustainable way. It tackles a pressing need in both the U.S. and the European markets: the ability to build affordable homes.

Litehaus, which launched early last year, calls itself the “Uber of construction,” with Thibault saying the company just wants to connect all the currently fragmented parts of the home-building process. It matches landowners and property developers with other professionals such as construction companies, architects, contractors, and interior designers. The company allows users to track costs, coordinate schedules with the hired workers, and track the progress of the building in real time.

“As a go-to-market strategy, we decided to focus mainly on modular construction, allowing us to build 30% cheaper, 40% faster, and 60% more sustainably,” Thibault said, adding that meant 90% less waste and 50% less CO2 emissions compared with traditional construction.

Others in the modular construction space include the U.S.-based Ginosko Modular and Flummerfelt and the India-based Schnelle Prefabs, according to PitchBook.

Litehaus has at least one U.S. construction company in its network as it looks to further its expansion in the country. Right now, it is focused on becoming “Europe’s fastest-growing construction tech startup,” Thibault said.

Plus, the European construction industry could use more innovation. Investors in America pour billions of dollars into rising construction technology, and, as usual, there is much room for the European tech industry to catch up.

Investors here and across the pond clearly agree. Last week, Litehaus announced a €1.46 million pre-seed round, co-led by the U.K.’s Cornerstone VC and Explorer Fund, one of Portugal’s largest private equity funds. Claster Group, a Luxembourgish family office, and angel investor Pascal Levy, a venture partner at Long Journey Ventures here in the U.S., also participated in the round.

“The shortage of housing across Europe has triggered a crisis, driving up the cost of living as home ownership becomes increasingly out of reach,” Rodney Appiah, a managing partner at Cornerstone VC, said. “When I first met Thibault and Simi, I was struck by their compelling vision: to make building a home as simple as buying one, catalyzing the construction industry to bring greater transparency, sustainability, quality, and trust to the home-building process.”

Thibault called the fundraising journey “intense.” He said he and Simi had known their lead investors for years through mutual friends. Thibault, who is from France, is the founder of an immersive gaming studio in Portugal, but he has also invested in numerous companies, both as an angel investor and through his work at firms 50 Partners and Origins, based in France and New York, respectively. Before that, he worked at a French mining company and in green tech.

Simi, meanwhile, was born in Nigeria and grew up in London. She ran a contemporary art gallery, a wellness brand for women of color, and worked as a consultant and strategist for various firms on law and Africa.

“I’ve always wanted to build businesses that change people’s lives,” Simi told TechCrunch. “Providing affordable homes at scale isn’t just a market opportunity — it’s one of the most meaningful ways we can create deep, lasting impact.”

She is now in charge of marketing, communication, and design at Litehaus, while Thibault handles fundraising, business development, and tech.

“When it came time to raise, we moved quickly with partners who already knew us and shared our vision from day one,” Thibault said. He said the fresh capital will be used to help scale the company and hire more talent in engineering, product, marketing, and operations.

It’s quite funny that Thibault and Simi built a company, raised over a million euros, and had two kids, before their home, a process they started working on over four years ago, was finally finished.

“We are actually moving in next month,” Thibault said. “We move in next month after a 14-month delay on completion. This is the pain point we are trying to solve for millions of people.”

Technical,"Opera on Tuesday revealed a new browser, calledOpera Neon, that will focus on AI workflows and performing tasks on your behalf, like shopping, filling out forms, and coding.

The browser is currently behind a waitlist, but the company said users will have to subscribe to use it once it releases. Pricing details were not disclosed.

Notably, Opera Neon browser features three new buttons on its sidebar: Chat, Do, and Make. Chat presents a chatbot interface with which you can search the web, get answers to your queries, and ask for more information about web pages you’re browsing.

Do uses the company’s Browser Operator AI agent, whichwas announced in March. This AI agent is supposedly capable of performing tasks like filling out forms or handling your trip bookings locally in the browser.

The Make option is also notable, as Opera says it can create games, websites, snippets of code, reports, and more with text prompts. The company said the AI workflows that enable this feature are performed through a virtual machine in the cloud, so Neon will work on tasks by itself even if you go offline, and users can run multiple tasks at the same time.

All this sounds great on paper, but suchAI apps often don’t perform as well as they’re said to. Plus, Opera is not the only company working on AI agents for browsers: The Browser Company teased an AI-powered browser last December thataims to have agents do stuff for you, and Google is working on projects thatwill return search results and even perform tasks using AI agents."
Technical,"Humain, the state-owned AI company from Saudi Arabia, is on track to launch a $10 billion venture fund, Humain Ventures, that will invest in startups in the U.S., Europe, and Asia, the Financial Timesreported, quoting Tareq Amin, Humain’s CEO.

Humain is in talks with U.S. firms like Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and Elon Musk’s xAI about its plans and is also exploring a deal with U.S. companies to sell an equity stake in its data center business, the report said.

Amin did not reveal which companies these are but said some are “massive names in the data center segment,” according to the report.

Humain was launched earlier this month ahead of a visit by U.S. president Donald Trump and several tech industry allies. Under anew Trump administration initiative, U.S. tech suppliers, including Nvidia and AMD, have been allowed to arrange deals with Saudi Arabian firms.

So far, Humain has struck deals with Qualcomm, Nvidia, AMD, andAmazonand plans to have 1.9 gigawatts of data center capacity by 2030. The plan is to process 7% of global AI training and inferencing by 2030, and the endeavor is expected to cost about $77 billion, the FT quoted Amin as saying."
Technical,"SpaceX’s Starship successfully separated from its Super Heavy rocket booster and reached orbit Tuesday evening, but later began spinning and made an uncontrolled reentry into the Indian Ocean. SpaceX had cleared the surrounding airspace where Starship was coming down, according to the company.

The ninth test flight provided a mix of successes and failures for the company. It was the smoothest Starship test of the year, following two consecutive explosions. Starship, launched atop the Super Heavy booster, lifted off from SpaceX’s facility in southern Texas on Tuesday evening. It was also the first launch to use a flight-proven Super Heavy booster, which had launched and returned during Starship’s seventh flight test.

The heavy booster successfully separated and Starship entered space. But the ship was unable to open a side cargo hatch to deploy mock satellites in one planned test. Later in the flight, Starship lost attitude control, meaning it could no longer orient itself properly for reentry.

The ninth flight test came less than a week after the Federal Aviation Administrationcleared SpaceXto perform the test flight of its Starship rocket system following those back-to-back explosions earlier this year.

In January,SpaceXcaught theStarship’s heavy booster rocketon its descent for a second time. Starship successfully separated from the booster and ignited its rockets to ascend to orbit, but it was soon lost after suffering an anomaly. Debris from Starship fell into the airspace near Puerto Rico, prompting the FAA to reroute several aircraft in the airspace.

SpaceX conducted another test in March. The Super Heavy booster successfully separated and wascaughtby the launch tower in Texas for a third time. Starship reached space, but eight minutes into the flight, the ship lost multiple Raptor engines and began to spiral.

As a result of the two explosions, the FAA expanded the size of hazard areas in the U.S. and other countries for the flight based on an updated safety analysis provided by SpaceX. After completing an investigation in the loss of Starship on its eighth flight test, SpaceX made several hardware changes to increase reliability."
Technical,"Anthropic has begun to roll out a “voice mode” for its Claude chatbot apps.

The voice mode (in beta for now) allows Claude mobile app users to have “complete spoken conversations with Claude,” and will arrive in English over the next few weeks, according to Anthropic’sofficial account on Xandupdated documentationon the company’s website.

At leastone user on Xreports having gained access to voice mode late Tuesday. By default, it’s powered by Anthropic’sClaude Sonnet 4model.

“Voice mode … enables you to speak to Claude and hear responses through voice, making it easier to use Claude when your hands are busy but your mind isn’t,” reads asupport page. “Voice mode transforms how you interact with Claude by … displaying key points on-screen as Claude speaks [and] allowing you to speak to Claude and hear Claude’s voice responses.”

A number of AI companies, including OpenAI, offer voice chat experiences for their respective chatbots. Google, for example, hasGemini Live, while xAI has Voice Mode for Grok. Each lets users interact with bots by speaking instead of typing, making conversations feel more natural and intuitive.

With Anthropic’s flavor of voice mode, users can chat about things like documents and images, and choose from five distinct voice options. Users can also switch between text and voice on the fly, and see a transcript and summary following conversations.

The capability has certain limits. Voice conversations count toward regular usage caps — Anthropic says that 20-30 conversations is what most free users can expect. Moreover, only paid Claude subscribers can take advantage of a Google Workspace connector that allows voice mode to access Google Calendar appointments and Gmail emails (Google Docs integration is exclusive to Claude Enterprise plans).

Anthropic CPO Mike Kriegerconfirmedthe company was working on voice capabilities for Claude in an interview with the Financial Times in early March. According to the report, Anthropic was holding talks with Amazon, the company’s major investor and partner, and voice-focused AI startup ElevenLabs, to possibly drive future voice features for Claude.

It’s unclear which of those partnerships, if any, came to fruition."
Technical,"OpenAI is exploring ways for users to sign in to third-party apps using their ChatGPT account, the company noted on aweb pagepublished Tuesday. OpenAI is currently gauging interest from developers who might want to integrate this service into their apps.

ChatGPT is quickly becoming one of the largest consumer applications in the world, now with roughly600 million monthly active users. To capitalize on this popularity, OpenAI seems eager to try and expand into other consumer areas, such asonline shopping,social media, andpersonal devices.A potential “Sign in with ChatGPT” feature could help OpenAI compete with other massive consumer technology companies — such as Apple, Google, and Microsoft — that help people with a wide range of online services, including a quick way to sign in to third-party apps.

Earlier this month, OpenAI launched apreview of the “Sign in with ChatGPT”experience for developers in Codex CLI, the company’s open source AI coding tool for terminals. The feature let developers connect their ChatGPT Free, Plus, or Pro accounts to their API accounts. OpenAI offered Plus users $5 in API credits to sign in with ChatGPT, and Pro users $50 in API credits.

OpenAI seems to be interested in integrating the sign-in service with a broad array of companies. The developer interest form asks for companies to specify their app’s user base, ranging from tiny companies with fewer than 1,000 weekly users to massive apps with over 100 million weekly users. The form also asks developers how they charge for AI features today and whether they’re customers of the OpenAI API.

CEO Sam Altmannoted in 2023that the company may look into a “sign in with OpenAI” feature in 2024. However, it now appears OpenAI is more seriously building out the capability today, in 2025. It’s unclear when the sign-in feature would go live for users of ChatGPT or how many companies have signed up to be part of it.

OpenAI did not immediately respond to TechCrunch’s request for comment."
Technical,"In May 2025, Mozilla announced that it wasshutting down the popular read-it-later app Pocket, which it had acquiredback in 2017 for an undisclosed amount.

While Pocket helped users save and discover millions of articles, Mozilla said the way people are browsing the web is changing, and it plans to focus its resources on other projects.

Pocket users have until October 8, 2025, to export their saved articles and other items, including lists, archives, favorites, notes, and highlights. This essentially means you will have to find a new home to build a reading list through another save-it-later app.

To help users with this transition, we’ve rounded up a number of apps you might want to consider.

Matteris aGoogle Ventures-backed companythat makes an eponymous iOS app along with browser extensions for Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. The app lets you listen toarticles and transcribes your favorite podcasts. Though the app itself is free to use, you can pay $79.99 per year to unlock features like improved transcriptions for podcasts and YouTube videos, tools to adjust reading speed, and additional integrations with other apps like notes apps, Gmail, and Kindle.

In March 2025, the company also addedan AI-powered co-readerto answer questions about different topics users might have while reading an article.

Matter co-founder Ben Springwater says Pocket users can email him atben@getmatter.comfor a personal discount link. The company will soon offer the discount within its app and will launch a migration process for Pocket users.

Instapaper, which was founded by developer Marco Arment in 2008, is one of the oldest read-it-later apps. It’s available on both iOS and Android, and lets you save unlimited articles and videos without paying any fees. It wasacquired by Pinterest in 2016.

However, for $59.99 per year, you can add notes to saved articles, have a permanent archive of articles in your accounts, create a text-to-speech playlist to listen to stories, enable full text search for all saved items, and get the ability to send articles to your Kindle.

The company saysPocket users can import their account into Instapaperat instapaper.com/user. Users who import this way will also receive an email offering a three-month free trial to Instapaper Premium.

Raindropworks primarily as an alternative bookmark manager for web browsers. However, its accompanying mobile apps for iOS and Android allow you to read your saved articles or PDFs at any time. The free version gives you unlimited bookmark saving along with integrations like Zapier and IFTTT.

If you decide to pay $33 per year, you will get AI-powered suggestions for organizing your content better, full text-search, reminders for your bookmarks, a duplicate and broken links finder, and a file upload limit of 10GB per month.

Former Twitter engineer Joe Fabisevichcreated Plinky to allow users to save and categorize any kind of link, including articles, videos, recipes, and memes. The app is available across all Apple platforms, along with browser extensions to save links. Once you’re signed up,Plinkylets you use folders and tags to categorize your links, and even set reminders to read them at a specific time.

You can save 50 links, create three folders, and use five tags with the free version. To remove these restrictions, you can pay $3.99 per month, $39.99 a year, or a one-time fee of $159.99. Pro users are able to save unlimited links, create an unlimited number of folders, use an unlimited number of tags, and set an unlimited number of reminders.

With Pocket’s shutdown on the horizon,Fabisevich saysa dedicated Reader Mode will soon be added to Plinky’s app. The app is also offering a 50% discount on the Pro tier through the end of May 2025.

Paperspanis a very simple app that offers a reading list across devices; allows you to add notes; and has text-to-speech functionality. The app is free, but it offers an $8.99 per month subscription to unlock advanced search, as well as the ability to create playlists, show reading stats, and send your articles to Kindle. Though the app works, PaperSpan hasn’t been updated for some time, which may not be a good signal about its long-term future. The app is available on both iOS and Android.

Readwise, a tool to add notes and highlights to articles, launched itsReader app in 2021. The app allows you to import RSS feeds, YouTube videos, Twitter threads, and more to read at your convenience. Because of its integration with Readwise, the Reader app offers great annotation features. It also features offline text search and an AI assistant.

Plus, you can integrate Reader with knowledge management apps such as Obsidian, Notion, Roam Research, Evernote, and Logseq. The app is free to try for 30 days, and then you have to pay a $9.99 per month Readwise subscription to access it.

Readwise is letting Pocket users save their entire Pocket archive into Readerand notes that its app supportsa number of features — like PDFs, ePubs, X posts, AI, and filtering — which Pocket never did.

DoubleMemoryis a new indie app focused on the Apple ecosystem, and it has native apps for both Mac and iOS. On Mac, you can easily save any link or content by pressingCmd + Ctwice. The saved content will then appear in a Pinterest-style tile format.

The app also allows you to read offline and search through text, notes, and tags. You don’t need an account to start using DoubleMemory. And if you have multiple apps, it uses your iCloud account to sync content across them.

DoubleMemory is free with in-app purchases. It offers a $3.99 monthly subscription or an annual subscription of $17.99.

Recallworks as a browser extension and a mobile app that allows users to save content from the web, including articles, PDFs, blog posts, podcasts, Wikipedia pages, YouTube videos, and recipes. However, unlike traditional read-it-later apps, Recall uses AI to automatically summarize content, categorize it, and then resurface it when it’s related to something new you’re looking to learn about.

Designed to enhance your ability to remember information, you can review your summaries from your personal knowledge base on a saved spaced repetition schedule.

Recall is free to try with support for up to 10 free, AI-generated summaries. After that, you can continue to use Recall as a read-it-later tool, or you canupgradeto a $7 per month plan for unlimited AI summaries and other features.

Wallabagis an open source read-it-later app that’s also available as an €11 per year hosted subscription, if you prefer. The app itself works across browsers and mobile devices, offers a reader mode for more comfortable reading, and supports importing data from other services like Pocket, Instapaper, and others.

Open source web appReadeckis designed to help you organize any web content you want to revisit later, whether that’s articles, videos, photos, or anything else. You can also use the service to highlight text, export articles to e-book format, save video transcripts, and more.

Readeck works as a browser extension so you can save your bookmarks as you surf the web. Users can host Readeck themselves, but the company says it will offer a hosted version in 2025. It’s also developing a mobile app.

Obsidian‘sweb clipping servicelets you highlight and capture web pages you want to save with just a click on its browser extension. You can also use templates that customize how certain types of web pages are saved. For instance, articles are saved with their citations and footnotes, while recipes will include ingredients, steps, and nutrition. You can even set up custom templates to save from your favorite websites.

As an open source app, Web Clipper is free to use, allowing you to highlight text, images, and blocks of content for saving into theObsidiannote-taking app.

Karakeep‘s bookmarking app lets you save links, notes, and images, and then uses AI to automatically tag items and make retrieving them faster. The app includes other features like support for lists, bulk actions, dark mode, full-text search, and more.

Theopen source appis available on iOS and Android as a browser extension for Chrome and Firefox. You can support its developerhere.

Deweyis another “save everything”-style app that lets you save and organize web links, videos, and images, including posts from social media sites like X, TikTok, Bluesky, Threads, Reddit, Instagram, LinkedIn, and others.

The service offers built-in organizational tools like folders and tags, AI bulk tagging, keyboard shortcuts, automatic syncing to Notion, export, a personalized RSS feed, and more. Dewey offers multipleplans, starting at $7.50 per month, which you can choose to pay annually for $30 off.

Technical,"Gov. Abbott of Texas officially signed into law the online child safety bill that will require Apple and Google’s app stores to verify the age of their users and obtain approval from parents before minors download or make in-app purchases. The law will go into effect on January 1.

The bill made headlines last weekas it was revealedApple CEO Tim Cook reportedly called Gov. Abbott in hopes of convincing him to either ditch or make changes to the law after it passed the Texas legislature. Apple, alongside Google, was working with interest groups to fight the legislation, with Apple in particular saying that the implementation of such a bill could pose a threat to user privacy.

Apple lobbyists managed to stop a similar bill from passing in Louisiana last year, though the state is revisiting the bill.

Technical,"Most delivery automation stops at the curb. But forVehoand Zurich-based robotics startup Rivr, the real challenge — and opportunity — lies in those final 100 yards from van to doorstep.

In a pilot program launching Tuesday in Austin, Rivr’s four-wheeled, stair-climbing delivery robot, which CEO and founder Marko Bjelonic describes as “a dog on roller skates,” will ferry packages from Veho’s vans directly to customers’ front doors.

The companies are starting small, they told TechCrunch exclusively. Just one highly supervised robot will work daily, making five- to six-hour runs over the span of a couple weeks throughout Austin. But both companies see it as a critical step toward solving a unique slice of the end-to-end autonomous delivery journey.

Bjelonic says in last-mile delivery, “robotics makes an impact by actually solving these very challenging problems that are actually quite easy for humans but hard for robots. And we see [Rivr] as a differentiator, almost as the next evolutionary step from the sidewalk robots.”

The partnership with Veho also gives Rivr an opportunity to both test its technology and accumulate data necessary to build a general physical AI framework.

“What we have seen in the robotic space is that there’s a data barrier, because ChatGPT and other chatbots have the internet as training data, and autonomous cars have thousands of cars on the street that they can attach sensors to and start collecting data,” Bjelonic told TechCrunch. “But in the robotics world, that kind of dataset is missing, so you need to find the meaningful use case where you can solve a real problem, and then you can start collecting all of the data to make these robots more intelligent.”

For Veho, which delivers across 50 U.S. markets for brands like Sephora, Saks, HelloFresh, and more, this partnership is a chance to test what automation looks like from the van to the customer’s door. That could eventually allow for more deliveries to take place at once, particularly in dense urban areas where both the driver and the robot can tag-team a particular street simultaneously. Bjelonic says Rivr’s “robot helpers” can also “reduce the workload on these drivers” by taking over the physically demanding task of walking door to door.

During the Austin trial, a Rivr employee will accompany the bot to ensure safety and delivery quality. Bjelonic told TechCrunch the bots can operate autonomously, but remote operators will be able to tap in if they get stuck.

The Austin pilot will start in the more residential area of Northwest Austin before expanding to denser areas of town, according to Fred Cook, Veho’s co-founder and CTO. In the future, Cook says he could imagine pairing the vehicles with certain types of vehicles with charging stations for the bots to keep them going for a full day of work.

Rivr hopes to use the learnings from its partnership with Veho to scale to 100 bots by next year and thousands in 2027. The startup is currently operating in the U.K. through a partnership with delivery platform Evri. Rivr has raised more than $25 million, including from a Jeff Bezos-led round thatvalued the company at $100 million."
Technical,"Meta isdividing its AI department into two new teams, according to a report from Axios. Now the company’s AI personnel will be assigned to an AI products team, or an AGI Foundations unit. No jobs appear to have been cut.

The AI products team will focus on consumer-facing efforts like the AI features within Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, as well as Meta’s newstand-alone AI app.

The AGI Foundations unit will focus on more of the bigger picture efforts, like improving its Llama models.

As companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic make moves, Meta is trying its best to stay neck-and-neck with the competition. The company recently launched aLlama for Startupsprogram to encourage early-stage companies to use their products for generative AI applications. Meanwhile, much of Meta’sLlamaConevent in April was geared toward showing that it can compete with OpenAI."
Technical,"If and when AI will start replacing human labor has been the subject of numerous debates.

While it’s still hard to say with certainty if AI is beginning to take over roles previously done by humans, a recent survey from theWorld Economic Forumfound that 40% of employers intend to cut staff where AI can automate tasks.

Researchers at SignalFire, adata-driven VC firmthat tracks job movements of over 600 million employees and 80 million companies on LinkedIn, believe they may be seeing first signs of AI’s impact on hiring.

When analyzing hiring trends, SignalFire noticed that tech companies recruited fewer recent college graduates in 2024 than they did in 2023. Meanwhile, tech companies, especially the top 15 Big Tech businesses, ramped up their hiring of experienced professionals.

Specifically, SignalFirefoundthat Big Tech companies reduced the hiring of new graduates by 25% in 2024 compared to 2023. Meanwhile, graduate recruitment at startups decreased by 11% compared to the prior year. Although SignalFire wouldn’t reveal exactly how many fewer grads were hired according to their data, a spokesperson told us it was thousands.

While adoption of new AI tools might not fully explain the dip in recent grad hiring, Asher Bantock, SignalFire’s head of research, says there’s “convincing evidence” that AI is a significant contributing factor.

Entry-level jobs are susceptible to automation because they often involve routine, low-risk tasks that generative AI handles well.

AI’s newcoding, debugging,financial research, andsoftware installationabilities could mean companies need fewer people to do that type of work. AI’s ability to handle certain entry-level tasks means some jobs for new graduates could soon be obsolete.

Gabe Stengel, the founder of AI financial analyst startup Rogo, started his career at Lazard investment bank where he helped large pharma companies buy biotech startups. Rogo’s tool “can do almost all the work I did in the analysis of those companies,” Stengel said onstage at Newcomer’s financial technology summit last week. “We can put together the materials, diligence the company, look through their financials.”

While most large investment banks haven’t explicitly reduced analyst hiring due to AI yet, executives at firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley previously considered cutting junior staff hires by up to two-thirds and lowering the pay of those they hire because the work with AI is not as demanding as before, theNew York Timesreported last year.

Although AI’s threat to low-skilled jobs is real, tech companies’ need for experienced professionals is still rising. According to SignalFire’s report, Big Tech companies increased hiring by 27% for professionals with two to five years of experience, while startups hired 14% more individuals in that same seniority range.

A frustrating paradox emerges for recent graduates: They can’t get hired without experience, but they can’t get experience without being hired. While this dilemma is not new, Heather Doshay, SignalFire’s people and talent partner, says it is considerably exacerbated by AI.

Dashay’s advice to new grads: master AI tools. “AI won’t take your job if you’re the one who’s best at using it,” she said."
Technical,"WordPressannouncedon Tuesday that it has formed an AI team to steward the development of AI products among its developer community.

The team includes James LePage (leader of AI at Automattic, WordPress’ parent company), Felix Arntz and Pascal Birchler from Google, and Jeff Paul (Director of Open Source at web design firm 10up).

As one of the most dominant platforms for building websites, WordPress has already seen developers within its open source community experiment with AI tools. The creation of a formalized team signals that WordPress wants to take a more active role in organizing and moderating AI efforts among developers.

“A unified team stewards AI development thoughtfully, avoids fragmentation, and ensures alignment with the long-term goals of WordPress,” WordPress executive director Mary Hubbard wrote in ablog post.

Technical,"Self-driving truck startup TuSimple (now CreateAI) sent a trove of sensitive data — effectively the blueprint of an American-made autonomous vehicle system — to a Beijing-owned firm after committing to the U.S. government that it would cease such transfers under a national security agreement, according toThe Wall Street Journal.

The transfers to Chinese truck manufacturer Foton happened around February2022, just a week after TuSimple signed the agreement in which U.S. regulators ordered the company to separate its business and technology from China-based employees and partners with firewalls and governance controls. The data sharing continued up until TuSimple’s deadline to comply with the agreement six months later, according to hundreds of pages of correspondence that the Journal viewed.

A subsequent investigation with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. (CFIUS) found the data sharing didn’t technically violate the agreement, though TuSimple was fined for other infractions and paid a $6 million settlement without admitting fault, per the Journal.

TechCrunch was unable to reach TuSimple, now CreateAI, for comment.

Still, the saga of TuSimple’s data transfers to China exposes the limits of U.S. safeguards meant to balance foreign investment with national security. And it’s not just data that TuSimple has been trying to get across the border.

This latest revelation comes eight months afterTechCrunch reportedthat some of TuSimple’s shareholders were trying to block the company from transferring its U.S. funds — roughly $450 million at the time — to the company’s Chinese subsidiary to fund a pivot to AI animation and content generation. That drama is still unfolding as one of TuSimple’s co-founders, Xiaodi Hou, fights in court for control over his voting shares so he canpush for liquidationof the company. In December 2024,TuSimple officially rebranded to CreateAI.

The company has been embroiled in controversy since going public via IPO in 2021. TuSimple started as a China-backed startup founded in 2015 by Hou and Lu Chen, an entrepreneur with ties to Sina Corp. It quickly became an autonomous vehicle industry favorite, managing to raise around $2 billion from a mixture of Chinese and U.S.-based heavy hitters, and was one of the first in the U.S. to successfully complete a fully driverless run on public highways.

TuSimple’s plans took a turn for the worse amid internal struggles and federal investigations into the company’s ties with China, leading to its decision toexit U.S. operationsand voluntarily delisting from the stock market in January 2024. The goal was to restart self-driving operations in China, but both the CFIUS agreement and other court orders that barred the company from transferring assets — financial or otherwise — to China made it next to impossible to restart operations there, the company has told TechCrunch.

The Journal’s reporting sheds light on a previouslyreported controversy regarding Hydron, a Chinese hydrogen trucking startup founded by Chen, which shared an office with TuSimple China. The overlap between Hydron and TuSimple was the subject of the 2022 CFIUS probe, during which TuSimple revealed that its employees spent paid hours working for Hydron in 2021 and shared confidential information with the company.

According to documents the Journal viewed, TuSimple negotiated a deal in 2021 between Hydron and Foton to develop autonomous trucks. Foton, a subsidiary of state-owned BAIC Group, has an agreement with a Chinese military university to work on AV tech.

Through a combination of emails, Slack messages, and video calls, TuSimple sent partners technical instructions for server dimensions, brake designs, sensors, steering, power supply, and chips, per the Journal. Employees also routinely downloaded autonomy source code developed by their American counterparts.

As geopolitical tensions and competition with China rise, TuSimple’s ties are serving as a cautionary tale for Washington that has helped drive ashift in U.S. policy, prompting stricter rules on Chinese-linked tech deals and fueling a broader push to block high-risk transactions outright."
Technical,"Salesforce has acquired cloud data management firm Informatica in an $8 billion equity deal, marking a major move in its push to strengthen its AI and data infrastructure capabilities.

The announcement, made Tuesday, comes about a year after early rumors of the acquisition sent both companies’ stock pricessliding. At the time, Informaticadeniedit was for sale, but a lot can change in a year.

Under the terms of the deal, Salesforce will pay $25 in cash per share for Informatica’s Class A and Class B-1 common stock, adjusting for its prior investment in the company.

Informatica was founded in 1993 and works with more than 5,000 customers across more than 100 countries. Thecompany had a $7.1 billionmarket cap at the time of publication.

This acquisition will help bolster Salesforce’s agentic AI ambitions, the company’s press release stated, by giving the company more data infrastructure and governance to help its AI agents run more “safely, responsibly, and at scale across the modern enterprise.”

“Together, we’ll supercharge Agentforce, Data Cloud, Tableau, MuleSoft, and Customer 360, enabling autonomous agents to act with intelligence, context, and confidence across every enterprise,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in the press release. “This is a transformational step in delivering enterprise-grade AI that is safe, responsible, and deeply integrated with the world’s data.”

The path to this deal began in April 2024, when reports surfaced that Salesforce was eyeing Informatica. The market reaction was swift — both companies’ shares dipped on fears of a difficult integration or strategic mismatch. Informatica later issued a public statement denying any sale discussions. But what once seemed unlikely is now official.

Informatica isn’t the first data management company Salesforce has acquired in the past year. In September, Salesforcesnapped up Own Company for $1.9 billion in cash.

“Data security has never been more critical, and Own’s proven expertise and products will enhance our ability to offer robust data protection and management solutions to our customers,” Salesforce general manager Steve Fisher said in a press release at the time.

TechCrunch has reached out to Salesforce for more information."
Technical,"Tesla sales in Europe and the U.K. have fallen by nearly half, according to data released Tuesday by theEuropean Automobile Manufacturers Association. In April, Tesla sold 7,261 vehicles in the European Union, European Free Trade Association, and U.K., a 49% year-over-year decline.

The fall in sales is particularly alarming considering Tesla recently launched a new Model Y vehicle, the kind of release that would typically attract more consumers. A closer look at car sales in the region shows that Tesla competitors have not experienced the same decline, suggesting that CEO Elon Musk’s political activities and alignment with U.S. President Donald Trump have had anoutsized effect on the brand.

Tesla sales have struggled for months globally. Tesla recorded336,681 deliveries, its worst quarterly performance in more than two years. That dip in sales came as Muskled DOGE, the“advisory body”that laid off thousands of federal employees and attempted to eliminate entire agencies and programs. His involvement in the government has proven sounpopularthat Musk publicly stated he would refocus his efforts back on Tesla.

In April, new car registrations in the EU, U.K., and EFTA countries like Sweden and Norway fell 0.3 percent to 1,077,186 units year-over-year, with the gas and diesel vehicles seeing the largest declines.

EV sales still make up a smaller share of the overall market but continue to see growth. EV sales grew 27.8% to 184,685 vehicles in April compared to the same month in 2024. Hybrids, meanwhile, had the biggest jump with a 31% uptick in sales.

Meanwhile, figuresreleased last weekfrom market research firm Jato Dynamics shows Chinese manufacturers like BYD gaining ground despite tariffs by the EU. Registrations of EVs made by Chinese automakers in April rose by 59% year on year, reaching almost 15,300 units, according to Jato Dynamics."
